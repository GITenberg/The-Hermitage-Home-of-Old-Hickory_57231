<h1 title="">THE HERMITAGE: HOME OF OLD HICKORY</h1>
<div class="pb" id="Page_1">1</div>
<h2 id="c1">I: THE PRE-HERMITAGE PERIOD</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Put down in your book,&rdquo; said one of Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s old
neighbors to James Parton when that eminent biographer
was in Tennessee gathering material for his famous life of
Jackson, &ldquo;that the General was the prince of hospitality; not only
because he entertained a great many people but because the poor,
belated peddler was as welcome at the Hermitage as the President
of the United States and made so much at his ease that he
felt as though he had got home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Parton put it down in his book, and so preserved to posterity
that sincere and revealing tribute, eloquent in its simplicity,
from a neighboring farmer. There spoke a man who knew Andrew
Jackson not merely as the conqueror of the hostile Indians,
the Hero of New Orleans or the President of the United States,
but as the country gentleman who kept open house, who was
known and admired by his fellow farmers and who was celebrated
for his hospitality in a country where hospitality was a
common virtue.</p>
<p>If an old house has emotions of its own, as some of the poets
would have us believe, it is easy to think of the Hermitage blushing
with pride at that tribute. There are many stately mansions,
there are numerous great homes of famous men; but of how many
of these may it be truthfully said that within its walls the poorest
peddler with his pack found just as warm a welcome as the most
distinguished visitor?</p>
<p>Fortunately for succeeding generations the Hermitage, that
paragon of hospitality, is preserved just as it was in those early
days when Old Hickory himself was there to greet the way-worn
traveler&mdash;peddler or President&mdash;and make him feel at home.
Serene and stately in its grove of trees, flanked by its formal garden
and surrounded by its broad acres, it stands there a few miles
out from Nashville in all its classic and simple beauty. Here is
the home he built for himself and his beloved wife; the same old
house to which he returned in 1837 after eight turbulent years in
the White House; the place where he planted his cotton and raced
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
his horses, where he spent his last years, where he died and where
he is buried.</p>
<p>The visitor&rsquo;s first glimpse of the house is down through the
same old winding driveway, shaded with the native cedar trees
planted under Jackson&rsquo;s personal direction; and its broad fa&ccedil;ade is
seen through the trees, its graceful Corinthian columns gleaming
in the sunlight, just as it looked to the old General when he drove
up in his lumbering carriage drawn by his famous team of greys.
Off to the right is seen the formal flower garden he had laid out
for Mrs. Jackson in 1819; the garden where he laid her to rest
when she died in 1828, and along whose paths he found pleasure
and repose during the last year of his life. Inside the house
are found things just as he left them when he died&mdash;the hand-painted
wall paper, the massive mahogany furniture, the gleaming
silver, the books in their shelves in the library.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * *</span></p>
<p>As a persisting result of the astonishingly violent politics of
his day, the image of Andrew Jackson in the public mind today
is often blurred and distorted. In his campaign for the Presidency
he was the victim of such a torrent of cruel, personal vilification
as never before nor since has blackened the annals of
American politics. In newspapers, broadsides, and public addresses
he was persistently and vigorously denounced as an uncouth,
ignorant backwoods ruffian, a tipsy tavern brawler, a military
despot, an adulterer and an assassin. The voters of these
United States were urged to believe that, despite his spectacular
achievements as a militia general and Indian fighter, he was
morally, mentally and temperamentally unfit to sit in the President&rsquo;s
chair.</p>
<p>This barrage of malignant partisan propaganda did not succeed
in barring Jackson&rsquo;s way to the White House; but it did
have the effect of indelibly impressing on the minds of many
thousands of American citizens of those days the honest conviction
that Andrew Jackson was what we today tersely style a
&ldquo;roughneck;&rdquo; and that impression has persisted to a surprising
extent through succeeding generations even down to the present
time.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>But the Hermitage remains as an enduring and impressive challenge
to that erroneous characterization of this many-sided and
little understood statesman. This, it is plain to see, was the home
of no mere backwoodsman or ruffian. A mansion when it was
built more than a hundred years ago, it was obviously the seat of
a man of genteel characteristics, of refined, though simple taste.</p>
<p>It is no uncommon thing today for visitors to the Hermitage to
express surprise that such a house should have been built by Andrew
Jackson; but such surprise grows out of a misconception of
the man&rsquo;s true nature and characteristics.</p>
<p>The usually accepted picture of Jackson in the public mind is
largely the result of our American admiration of the primitive,
a love for the so-called manly and rugged qualities which sometimes
leads us into overdoing our humanizing of some of our early
heroes. As a matter of fact, Jackson, though not a college graduate,
was by no means a typical example of the popular conception
of an illiterate frontiersman. He had had formal schooling, had
studied law and had been admitted to the North Carolina bar
when at the age of twenty-one years he crossed the mountains
and came to the Cumberland settlements in what is now Tennessee.
His standard of education was notably higher than the average
of that day and locality. He came to the Cumberland country
as the state&rsquo;s attorney for the newly created Mero District, and
we may be sure that an uneducated, uncouth man would never
have been selected by the governor of North Carolina for this
important post.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although he was born in comparative poverty&mdash;a
posthumous child&mdash;his widowed mother, soon to die of yellow
fever while nursing wounded Revolutionary soldiers, had relatives
with whom to leave him. These relatives were people of
substance, ranking sufficiently high to entertain George Washington
on his visit to South Carolina in 1791, and they gave the
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
orphan Andrew the benefit of a boyhood spent amid the surroundings
of a prosperous and cultured Southern family.</p>
<p>So, while the youthful Andrew Jackson engaged in cock-fighting,
horse-racing and dueling, these were by no means unusual
pastimes for the high-spirited youths of that time. He had the
innate qualities of a gentleman; and those qualities find their
truest manifestation in the home he built for the declining years
of his wife and himself.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * *</span></p>
<p>The Hermitage, though it has gained world-wide fame as Andrew
Jackson&rsquo;s home, was not his dwelling place when he first
settled in the Nashville community in 1788. At that time the danger
of attacks by Indians had not yet entirely disappeared, and
residents of the outlying districts still frequently lived in &ldquo;stations&rdquo;&mdash;groups
of houses gathered about a central habitation, thus
offering the opportunity for protection against attack. At such a
station near Nashville lived the widow of John Donelson, who
had been one of the founders of the original Nashborough, and
it was in one of the cabins adjacent to her home that Andrew
Jackson lived when he settled in the new country. With him lived
his friend, John Overton, later his law partner and his lifelong
confidant and advisor. The two young lawyers hung out their
shingle together, with their office in the cabin where they lived,
taking their meals with the widow Donelson.</p>
<p>Living with Mrs. Donelson at this time was her daughter
Rachel, the estranged bride of a high-spirited and jealous Kentuckian
named Lewis Robards. The young couple had gone to
Kentucky to live when they married, but the jealous husband
made life with him intolerable and Rachel soon returned to her
mother&rsquo;s house, where Jackson found her when he went there to
live. Largely through the pacific efforts of John Overton, an old
friend of the Robards family, and at the instigation of Lewis
Robards&rsquo;s mother whose sympathies were with Rachel in the affair,
a reconciliation was patched up and Captain Robards came
to the widow Donelson&rsquo;s home late in 1788 to live again with his
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
wife. Soon, however, Robards created a new crisis by charging
Jackson with undue attentions to his wife. The fiery young lawyer
challenged Robards to a duel, but the challenge was declined
and in the spring of 1790 Robards returned to Kentucky with the
avowed intention of getting a divorce. In the fall of that year
the news drifted down to Nashville that the divorce had been
granted, and about a year later, in the latter part of 1791, Jackson
married Rachel.</p>
<p>The wedding ceremony took place in Natchez, Mississippi,
whither she had fled to escape from her husband&rsquo;s threats. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to haunt you!&rdquo; Robards told her when he left her; and she,
not knowing exactly what that threat implied but well knowing
her moody husband&rsquo;s erratic disposition, feared bodily harm and
thought it safest to get as far away from him as possible. The home
of relatives in Natchez provided a pleasing asylum in this emergency;
and so it was there that the marriage ceremony was performed.</p>
<p>But, alas, it developed that the news of the divorce was premature&mdash;the
marriage with Jackson was consummated before the attenuated
Kentucky divorce proceedings had been actually completed.
Legally, therefore, Mrs. Robards-Jackson was technically
guilty of bigamy; but the incensed Robards used a harsher term
in discussing the young Tennessee lawyer&rsquo;s relations with his erstwhile
wife. Jackson patched the thing up as best he could by having
another wedding ceremony promptly performed in January,
1794, after the Kentucky divorce was actually granted; but the irregularities
attending his marriage rose to plague him again and
again throughout his life, with his political enemies gleefully
making capital of the unfortunate episode to the fullest possible
extent.</p>
<p>Jackson at the time of his marriage, though still a young man,
was in prosperous circumstances. His success as a lawyer in the
new community had been almost instantaneous, due largely to an
unusual state of affairs existing in the Cumberland settlements
when he arrived there. Nashville was still a young and undeveloped
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
frontier town and up until the time of Jackson&rsquo;s arrival
boasted only one lawyer. This representative of the legal fraternity
had been retained as counsel for a sort of combination of
habitual debtors; and the result was that the merchants, as well
as other creditors, found it well-nigh impossible to collect what
was owing to them. When Jackson appeared on the scene and let
it be known that he was a lawyer looking for clients, he was immediately
offered these claims; and it was characteristic of him
that he accepted with avidity a difficult class of litigation from
which many other young lawyers might have shrunk. But Jackson&rsquo;s
physical and moral courage made him enjoy the kind of a fight
against odds that most people would avoid; and he prosecuted his
clients&rsquo; claims with such boldness and vim that he soon drove an
irresistible wedge into the debt-paying strike. Naturally this immediately
popularized him with the responsible elements in Nashville,
and his law practice quickly flourished. Within seven years
of his arrival in 1788 he had more cases on the docket in Davidson
County than all the other Nashville lawyers combined. In the four
terms of court in the county in 1794 there were 397 cases; Andrew
Jackson appeared as counsel in 288 of them.</p>
<p>Although he had accepted his official appointment with a
mental reservation and had really come out to Nashville on a sort
of prospecting trip, he soon decided to stay and grow up with the
new settlement. His position as attorney-general or public prosecutor
of the Mero District gave him distinction and naturally
strengthened his legal prestige, and his private law practice had
quickly developed to such an extent that at the time of his marriage
he enjoyed a comfortable income.</p>
<p>There is a persistent legend that Jackson quickly accumulated
vast holdings of land by reason of his practice of taking land
grants and acreage tracts in lieu of legal fees, and that when he
married he had so much land he hardly knew the extent of his
property. It is true that after he had been in Nashville several
years he did begin to trade and traffic in land, and gradually
blossomed into a land speculator on a grand scale whose holdings
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
ran into the thousands of acres. Contrary to tradition, however, at
the time of his marriage he did not own an acre of ground anywhere;
and he did not have a home to which to take his new bride.</p>
<p>The records are rather vague as to the first two or three years
of the married life of Andrew and Rachel; but, from all the available
facts, it appears that they spent at least a part of their honeymoon
living at or near Natchez and then returned to Nashville and
probably lived temporarily with Mrs. Donelson. But in February,
1792, the land transfer records show that Andrew Jackson bought
from John Donelson (Rachel&rsquo;s brother) a farm of 330 acres located
in the foot of Jones Bend of the Cumberland River, just
across the river from the home of old Mrs. Donelson on the Gallatin
Road.</p>
<p>Here on this 330-acre river farm Jackson established his first
home of his own. He called the place Poplar Grove&mdash;at least a
letter written to John McKee on May 16, 1794, is so headed. Apparently,
however, this name did not exactly suit him, for a letter
to John Coffee written the next year is dated from Poplar Flat. All
trace of his habitation on this farm has now disappeared, although
there is a faint reminiscence of his tenancy in a &ldquo;Jackson&rsquo;s well&rdquo;
still to be found in that neighborhood.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note, that this Jones Bend (now called Hadley&rsquo;s
Bend) was the site chosen by the United States government
for the location of its gigantic smokeless powder manufacturing
plant in 1917, and the acreage of Poplar Flat was swallowed up in
the consolidation of the farms that went to make up the great
powder plant tract. In honor of the old hero who once tilled these
acres, the operation was officially known as the Old Hickory
Powder Plant; and the little industrial town that has grown up
out of that development is now called Old Hickory.</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s personal affairs flourished while he was living at
Poplar Flat, and the land records of Davidson County in 1793
begin to show the first evidences of his land trading. As he prospered
he, as was natural, wanted a better and bigger place to live;
and so on March 16, 1796, he bought from one John Shannon a
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
tract of 640 acres further up in the bend of the river, and here he
set up his new home which he called Hunter&rsquo;s Hill.</p>
<p>There was a strange element of romance connected with this
selection of a place to live&mdash;perhaps by design, perhaps through
coincidence. It appears that when young Captain Robards effected
his reconciliation with Rachel in 1788 it was part of the
agreement that they would set up a home in Tennessee. At any
rate, Robards entered 640 acres, &ldquo;on the south side of Cumberland
River, beginning at an ash, thence south 234 poles, etc.&rdquo; for
which he paid the state of North Carolina at the rate of ten
pounds for each hundred acres. After his divorce in 1794 Captain
Robards&mdash;a little sadly, no doubt&mdash;sold his tract of land to John
Shannon of Logan County, Kentucky, and it was this self-same
piece of ground that Jackson bought from Shannon in 1796 and
on which he established his new home.</p>
<p>It seems unlikely that it was a mere coincidence that led Jackson
to take up his residence on the land originally selected for home-making
purposes by his predecessor in Rachel&rsquo;s affections. Did
she herself guide Captain Robards&rsquo; selection of the location in the
first place, and did she have some lingering sentimental attachment
for it which caused her to influence Jackson to buy it for her after
they were married? Who knows what was going on in Rachel&rsquo;s
head as her brilliant young husband began to clear the way for
their new home on the site where a few years ago she had expected
to live with her first mate?</p>
<p>The Hunter&rsquo;s Hill house no longer exists, having been destroyed
by fire long ago; but, from all accounts, it was a notable
home for its day and time. For one thing, it was of frame construction
when most of the frontier houses were built of logs; and
it was looked upon then as one of the fine houses of the community.
It had an elevated location and commanded an inspiring
view of the winding river and the fertile bend. Few if any young
married men in the Cumberland country had a better estate.</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson, the energetic young lawyer from the civilized
side of the mountains, was now established as a man of affairs in
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
the new settlements. His legal attainments had attracted such attention
outside of Nashville that in 1790 when the federal government
established &ldquo;The Territory South of the River Ohio&rdquo; George
Washington had appointed Jackson district attorney, an office he
held until 1796 when he was elected to serve in the convention
which in that year framed the constitution for the new state of
Tennessee.</p>
<p>But Jackson&rsquo;s great energy and great ambition made it impossible
for him to be satisfied with the activities incident to the
practice of law, holding public office and cultivating a farm. And
so it was not long before he established a store at Hunter&rsquo;s Hill,
a store at which, according to tradition, both he and Rachel waited
on the trade.</p>
<p>The business of the store was varied and extensive in its nature.
Goods such as the settlers needed were brought on from the East,
Philadelphia principally; and as the selling price in Nashville was
about three times the cost in Philadelphia, there was a good margin
of gross profit although the cost of transportation was high. A
typical invoice from Jackson&rsquo;s Philadelphia connections shows a
shipment of dry goods&mdash;linen, calico, nankeen, cambrick, gingham,
ribbons, buttons, thread, etc.&mdash;ivory combs, fancy silk handkerchiefs,
&ldquo;Spanish segars,&rdquo; gloves, hats and kid shoes, as well
as queensware, hand saws, screw augers, scissors, knives, etc. They
also sold other such pioneer necessities as salt, sugar, coffee, grindstones,
gunpowder, nails, bar iron and cow bells; not to mention
rum, brandy, claret and whiskey, which latter beverage retailed at
75c per gallon and which Jackson made in his own licensed still-house.</p>
<p>Money was a scarce article around the Nashville settlements in
those days and the store did much of its business on the primitive
basis of barter, taking in the customers&rsquo; cotton, bear skins, oak
staves, deer skins, feathers, beeswax, tallow or any other saleable
commodity. There was a market for all these things in Natchez
and New Orleans; and at intervals, whenever a boatload was accumulated,
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
it was floated down the river to those towns and there
converted into cash.</p>
<p>When Tennessee was made into a state in 1796 Andrew Jackson
was selected to serve as its lone member of the House of Representatives,
and he entered into the deliberations of Congress with
such spirit and distinction that in 1797, at the age of thirty-one, he
was elected to the United States Senate to take the place of William
Blount who had been impeached for alleged treasonable
transactions. But the Senate suited Jackson but little, and early in
1798 he resigned to accept a seat on the Superior Court of Tennessee.
In February, 1802, another honor was added to his lengthening
scroll when he was made major-general of the state militia,
and he held this office concurrently with his judgeship.</p>
<p>But Jackson suffered the traditional fate of the man who has too
many irons in the fire.</p>
<p>While he was thus engaged in the public service, his personal
fortunes were not prospering; and so in 1804 he resigned his place
on the bench and gave his whole attention to the task of trying to
straighten out the tangle into which his business affairs had
drifted, partly because of the financial panic which swept the
country in 1798 and 1799, and partly as a result of misplaced confidence.
The business depression carried down a supposedly
wealthy man in Philadelphia whose notes Jackson had accepted
and endorsed. Before he knew what was happening to him, he
found himself confronted with unexpected obligations; but it
was characteristic of Jackson that he met this heart-breaking situation
unflinchingly and paid every cent as it came due. It was a
painful process, however, for it involved selling off much of his
property and practically making a new start in life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our A. Jackson has made sale of his possessions,&rdquo; the firm of
Jackson &amp; Hutchings on July 31st, 1804, wrote to Boggs &amp; Davidson,
their New Orleans connection. &ldquo;He is to receive two-thirds of
the amount on Christmas day next. This, we flatter ourselves, will
enable us to meet all our debts next spring.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig4">

<p class="pcap">This entirely imaginary and erroneous picture of the Hermitage was used extensively and for a long time despite its
inaccuracy. This and similar pictures were based on a view printed in <i>The Jackson Wreath</i> in 1829 which was
admittedly drawn &ldquo;from a description furnished by a friend at Washington.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>So the creditors of Jackson &amp; Hutchings and of &ldquo;our A. Jackson&rdquo;
were satisfied; but so the Hunter&rsquo;s Hill estate, in which he
and Rachel took so much pride, passed into other hands, being
sold on July 6, 1804, to Colonel Edward Ward. &ldquo;Necessity (as security
for Thomas Watson and John Hutchings) compelled me to
sell the Hunter&rsquo;s Hill tract&rdquo; Jackson wrote in after years, with just
a trace of bitterness. The $10,000 received for the place helped
put Jackson back on his feet; but there must have been a tear in
Rachel&rsquo;s eye as she looked back over her shoulder at the home
where she had been so happy as the bride of the coming young
man.</p>
<p>And even the financial relief did not come immediately, for
Colonel Ward made the purchase on long and involved terms. He
delivered to Jackson the bond of a Mr. Lew Jones for &pound;1670, Virginia
currency, (equivalent to $5,566.67 in Tennessee money),
due on December 15, 1804. He paid $1,794.91 in cash in January,
1805; $463.71 in cash in February; and in March $666.67 in cash
and 6,899 pounds of cotton, worth $1,000.35 at the then price of
14&frac12; cents per pound. Payments then ceased, and on May 7th
Jackson wrote Ward a strongly worded dunning letter insisting
on the payment of the balance of $1,721.88 still due. &ldquo;When you
recollect,&rdquo; he wrote to Colonel Ward, &ldquo;that I turned myself out of
house and home, by the sale of my possessions to you, purely to
meet my engagements, you must know that the anxiety must be
great in my mind to meet them, with the sacrifice of ease and comfort
that I made upon that occasion. I need only to add that my
creditors are growing clamorous and I must have money from
some source.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ward, in response to this appeal, paid $278.22 on account, and
then instituted a quibble on the ground that he should be permitted
to pay the balance in negroes rather than in cash. Jackson
vigorously refuted this suggestion, saying: &ldquo;I can not believe that
you are seriously impressed with the belief that you are now authorized
to discharge a part of the debt in negroes. Had negroes
been offered before Mr. Hutchings descended the river with
negroes for sale they would have been received, notwithstanding
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
the lapse of time. Of his departure you were informed by me,
with the express design that you might discharge part of the debt
in negroes if you thought proper, which if you had I would have
been in cash for them before this. As you did not have negroes
then, and the time elapsed, I did (and with propriety) conclude
that you had provided other means to meet your engagement; and
negroes would not have been named after we had sent on to
market and the time so far elapsed.&rdquo; Jackson also refused Ward&rsquo;s
proffer of real estate in settlement of the balance due, pointing
out that if his own creditors would accept real estate in payment of
their claims he could dispose of all his debts &ldquo;in four hours.&rdquo; He
then went on to say that he must have cash the following week and
that if he did not receive it he would be obliged to offer Ward&rsquo;s
bond for sale (an extreme step to take in those days). &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said
Jackson, &ldquo;my engagements I must meet. This was the object of the
sale of my possessions, and from that sale I must realize that
object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor General Jackson! It is hard to imagine a worse plight than
to sacrifice a dearly beloved house and home in order to get money
to pay one&rsquo;s debts&mdash;and then not get the money without a year&rsquo;s
unpleasant squabbling.</p>
<p>The Hunter&rsquo;s Hill place was repurchased by Jackson, perhaps
for sentimental reasons, during the more prosperous later days
when he was President; but it was on the market again in 1840
when financial embarassment again made it necessary for the General
to dispose of some of his property. The price at which it was
then offered was $15,000, which he considered a very low price for
it; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a little imprudence (on the part of Andrew,
junior,) has caused this necessity, and I would always rather sacrifice
property than the credit of my adopted son or myself.&rdquo; Fifteen
thousand dollars may have been a bargain price, as the General
said; but he was able to find no buyer at that figure and late in 1840
he sold it to Mrs. Elizabeth E. Donelson, widow of his wife&rsquo;s
brother John, for $12,000; and it is still in the hands of descendants
of this branch of the family.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>In 1804, after paying off his debts, practically all of Jackson&rsquo;s
remaining assets were embraced in his reduced land holdings, including
the tract of 420 acres adjoining Hunter&rsquo;s Hill which he
bought from Nathaniel Harp when forced to sell his home place.
It was to this plantation, the future Hermitage estate, that he repaired
when forced to give up Hunter&rsquo;s Hill.</p>
<p>Just when the removal was made is not accurately revealed by
the records. In a letter written in 1844 he stated that he bought the
Hermitage land &ldquo;on the 5th of July, 1804.&rdquo; His last recorded letter
from Hunter&rsquo;s Hill is dated August 25, 1804, and the first one
from the Hermitage April 7, 1805. It seems probable, however,
that the removal to the Hermitage plantation had been in contemplation
even before adversity forced it; for in the Jackson
papers is a receipt dated March 2, 1803, for 500 apple trees and
500 peach trees &ldquo;for the Hermitage orchard;&rdquo; and in a letter written
to Rachel on March 22, 1803, while he was attending court in
East Tennessee he inquires solicitously about the planting and
care of these young trees. Apparently thus early he was getting the
Hermitage tract ready for occupancy; although the county records
show that the land was not transferred to him until July, 1804.</p>
<p>The sale of the Hunter&rsquo;s Hill property necessarily forced the
removal of the store, and led to the establishment of a much more
pretentious business enterprise at Clover Bottom. Here he set up
not only a store but a tavern and boatyard as well, and he encouraged
the establishment of a race track and stables in which he took
an interest. This made Clover Bottom a center of interest for the
whole countryside and a favorite place for the assembling of the
people. Clover Bottom is located on the Nashville-Lebanon Road,
where it crosses Stone&rsquo;s River, just above that stream&rsquo;s confluence
with the Cumberland, and it was therefore an unexcelled location
for a man who operated a boatyard as well as a store and who also
had blooded horses and liked to see them run.</p>
<p>Soon after the establishment of the store at Hunter&rsquo;s Hill the
mercantile business had grown to such proportions that Jackson
could not handle it by himself, and he had taken in a partner
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
named Thomas Watson. This partnership did not work out satisfactorily,
however, and was dissolved, after which he took in John
Hutchings, whose father had married Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s sister. The
firm of Jackson and Hutchings thrived and even showed itself an
early disciple of the chain-store idea by establishing branch stores
at Gallatin and Lebanon. When the business was moved to Clover
Bottom, John Coffee, who was a brother-in-law of Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s
was also taken into the partnership.</p>
<p>By dint of hard work and close application, Jackson at length
managed to clear himself of his financial troubles; but it was a
long, hard pull, and for several years he felt the pinch of reduced
circumstances. In fact, so difficult was his situation that in 1810
the whole course of his life was near to being changed, and a
slight turn of the balance in the other direction then would have
found him selling out in Tennessee and removing elsewhere to
begin life over again in a new field. At this time the Hermitage
plantation was definitely on the market, and Jackson was actively
seeking some appointment that would take him elsewhere.</p>
<p>It will be recalled that Jackson fought his duel with Charles
Dickinson in 1806, and the death of Dickinson in this tragic affair
shocked the sensibilities of even the hardy pioneer citizens of
Nashville who were accustomed to duelling. A few days after the
duel Jackson&rsquo;s old friend and former law partner, John Overton,
wrote him the following comforting, friendly letter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dear Genl:</p>
<p>Until yesterday evening, I must confess, my mind was not at ease. I
was then relieved. To-day I have seen my brother who tells me of a little
circumstance I did not know, that you were a little touched, but not to do
any great damage. Pope in his Essay on Man says: &ldquo;Whatever is, is
right.&rdquo; To this small inconvenience we must submit, which is not much
more than the stumping of a toe, or the like.</p>
<p>It too frequently happens that the honest, unsuspecting part of society
will be infested with reptiles, the heads of which must be sought after
and bruised so as to be secure from their poison. God has so ordained
it. You have been the instrument of doing so. Fear nothing. As soon as
possible I will see you. Our mutual friend, Wm. P. Anderson, will come
to see you, who makes my best wishes for you.</p>
<p>Apropos, aside, there is a few long faces in town, though but few, for
it seems that this new-fangled Ajax had even went so far as to bet in
town, before he went over, that he would kill Genl. Jackson.
<span class="lr">Yr friend, <span class="sc">Jno. Overton</span></span>
<span class="jl">Gen&rsquo;l Jackson.</span> <span class="lr">Nashville, June 1806.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>This consoling letter from his old friend must have laid unction
to Jackson&rsquo;s soul; but not all of the Nashville citizens accepted
Dickinson&rsquo;s tragic death with Judge Overton&rsquo;s complacency. The
unfortunate victim of the duel had some warm and influential
friends in Nashville; and they spent their days and nights industriously
giving circulation to an account of the duel which
placed Jackson in the worst possible light. His popularity suffered
accordingly. Then close on the heels of this tragedy came the embroglio
with Aaron Burr into which he had permitted himself to
become innocently entangled. Jackson&rsquo;s popularity in Tennessee
was never at a lower ebb&mdash;and he was not a man to regard such
a state of affairs with resignation. On top of all this, he was worried
about his financial affairs, and it is easy to understand how
he might have been attracted by the idea of starting life over again
in a new location&mdash;and with a government job carrying a comfortable
salary.</p>
<p>Mississippi was a new country, the government of which was
just being organized, and Jackson wrote to Jenkyn Whitesides,
United States Senator from Tennessee, regarding the possibility
of receiving a federal appointment as judge in the new territory.
&ldquo;From my pursuits for several years past,&rdquo; he wrote in February,
1810, &ldquo;from many unpleasant occurrences that took place during
that time, it has given my mind such a turn of thought that I have
labored to get clear of. I have found this impossible, and unless
some new pursuit to employ my mind and thoughts, I find it impossible
to divest myself of those habits of gloomy and peevish
reflections that the wanton and flagitious conduct and unmerited
reflections of base calumny heaped upon me has given rise to.&rdquo; It
had occurred to him, he said, that new scenes might serve to relieve
him from this unpleasant tone of thought, and he was therefore
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
serving notice that he would accept the judgeship if it were offered
him. As a further reason for his dissatisfaction he cited the &ldquo;lethargy
and temporizing conduct&rdquo; of the government, and he expressed
the fear that &ldquo;as a military man I shall have no amusement or
business, and indolence and inaction would shortly destroy me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s nephews in Natchez, Donelson Caffery,
heard of his uncle&rsquo;s plan to sell the Hermitage home place and remove
to Mississippi, and he hastily wrote to dissuade him. &ldquo;You
have nearly got through all your embarrassments,&rdquo; wrote young
Caffery, &ldquo;You have a delightful farm, from the products of which
you will at least be able to live comfortably; by the respectable and
well-informed part of the country you are highly esteemed; you
are able to select a good society from your neighborhood.&rdquo; And,
concluding in a burst of eloquence: &ldquo;You have been able there to
read the characters of men in their actions; here another volume
will be presented to your view in which human baseness will take
up a considerable part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson persisted, however, in his effort to sell the Hermitage,
offering it among others to Colonel Wade Hampton of South
Carolina, who later served on his staff at New Orleans. Colonel
Hampton made a trip to Tennessee and looked the property over
but did not buy it, although he wrote: &ldquo;I am vastly partial to your
elegant seat and fine tract of land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps the advice of young Caffery and his other friends persuaded
him not to make the prospective changes; perhaps he was
not able to get the desired appointment. At any rate, fortunately
for Tennessee and for the country, Jackson remained at the Hermitage
and was soon thereafter relieved of his melancholic frame
of mind by the declaration of war against Great Britain in 1812.
From then on until 1821 he found plenty of &ldquo;amusement and
business&rdquo; in fighting the Indians and the British and the Spaniards
in Florida; and for eight years he had no further cause for complaint
on the score of indolence and inaction. He returned to the
Hermitage the nation&rsquo;s idol, and all thoughts of moving to Mississippi
or anywhere else were permanently dismissed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>When Jackson moved to the Hermitage tract from Hunter&rsquo;s
Hill his financial condition did not permit of his building immediately
another such home as he had left. But Jackson had the
primitive virtue of cutting his suit to fit his cloth; and so he set
himself up in a comfortable but crude establishment made up of a
group of log houses&mdash;a large central building, two stories high,
which constituted the principal living quarters, with three adjacent
log houses which were used as sleeping quarters for guests or
members of the family. The main building, which, according to
tradition, had in earlier days been used as a block house for defense
against the Indians, was 24 by 26 feet and on the first floor
had only one large room, with a huge fireplace. At the back was a
lean-to containing two rooms, a pantry and a bed-room. This big
room on the first floor was a combination of parlor, living room,
dining room and kitchen, with all the meals cooked at the big
open fireplace. Here Jackson lived for fifteen years&mdash;fifteen of the
most active years of his life, years when he was carving his name
as one of the really big men of the young United States.</p>
<p>Here in this log house he entertained some of the most distinguished
visitors who ever came to the Nashville settlements&mdash;President
James Monroe and Aaron Burr, among others; here it
was they brought him, well-nigh fatally wounded, from his duel
with Charles Dickinson; and it was to this rude abode that he returned
in 1815, following the Battle of New Orleans, with the
plaudits of the world ringing in his ears. Also, it was while he was
living here in the log Hermitage that he conducted his famous
campaigns against the Indians, including his celebrated invasion
of Florida which so nearly involved us in war with Spain.</p>
<p>Today there is still standing only one of the small log cabins of
the original group. Alongside it is a larger log house, with a
steeply sloping roof, built at a later date out of the logs taken from
the original two-storied log house which had been permitted to
fall into decay. These are located in the meadow a few hundred
yards to the rear of the present Hermitage, on the original site, and
are in a fair state of preservation. Although the original two-storied
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
house no longer stands, the remains of its stone foundation
are still faintly to be seen.</p>
<p>But by 1819 Andrew Jackson&mdash;in personal taste, in fame and in
social position&mdash;had outgrown the log-house mode of living. He
had become a man of national, even international, distinction; he
had been to Washington, to Philadelphia, New York and New
Orleans. He knew how distinguished men were supposed to live.
And so there gradually grew in his mind the determination to
build a new home, one that would befit his present station in life
and one that would permit Rachel to entertain with pride the
grandest ladies of the land. Fortunately for his plans, there was a
boom market in cotton from 1815 to 1818, following the treaty
of peace with England, and the cotton planters of the South had
three fat years. With cotton at 34c a pound, many of them waxed
wealthy; and although there was a slump in 1819, it appears that
Jackson must have been making financial hay while the sun was
shining, for it was at this time that he started work on his new
house.</p>
<p>The source from which Jackson got the name &ldquo;The Hermitage&rdquo;
remains more or less of a mystery. The plantation was known by
this name before he built a house on it; but nothing in his letters
or papers reveals the reason why it was so-called. There is a tradition
in the Donelson family that it was named in honor of the
old Donelson home-place in Virginia; but this theory has no
firmer foundation than tradition&mdash;it may be true, but there is no
authentic substantiation of it. There is a theory (although it is
nothing more than a theory) that he borrowed the name from
Jeremy Bentham&rsquo;s estate in England. Students of Jackson&rsquo;s political
beliefs feel that he was strongly influenced by the great
English philosopher and jurist, whose home was called the Hermitage.
He read Bentham&rsquo;s works and corresponded with him;
it is not unlikely that when it came to selecting a name for his new
plantation he thought of Bentham&rsquo;s home, the Hermitage, and
adopted the name for his own use.</p>

<h2 id="c2">II: ORIGINAL BUILDING, FIRE AND REBUILDING</h2>
<p>The Hermitage today is identically as it was when
Andrew Jackson died in 1845. Nothing has been added to
it; nothing has been taken away. But as it stands now, and
as it stood in 1845, it is much more elaborate architecturally than
the original house built in 1819. Additions were made to the first
building in 1831, and some further elaboration was done in 1834
when the house was reconstructed after being damaged by fire.
The fire at that time only partially destroyed the house; it did not
seriously injure the stone foundations and the stout brick walls,
and these are today practically the same as when they were built in
1819, except that to cover up the smoke stains the front wall was
painted white&mdash;an idea perhaps borrowed from the painting of
the White House in Washington in 1816 to conceal the evidence
of its having been burned by the British.</p>
<p>Parton, who had the advantage of talking with Jackson&rsquo;s contemporaries,
is authority for the statement that the Hermitage was
built in 1819, the work on it beginning in the summer of that year
when the General had returned from the Seminole war in such
bad health that he was doubtful whether he would live long.
Parton says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Lewis tells me that he rode out to the Hermitage one
day soon after General Jackson began to get about after his severe
illness. With slow and faltering steps, leaning heavily on his stick,
the General took him to the site selected for the new residence&mdash;a
very level spot in a large flat field, near the old block-house. Major
Lewis recommended another site slightly elevated above the
almost prarie-like level of the farm. &lsquo;No, Major,&rsquo; said the General,
&lsquo;Mrs. Jackson chose this spot, and she shall have her wish. I am
going to build this house for <i>her</i>. I don&rsquo;t expect to live in it myself.&rsquo;
And there the house was built.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Mrs. Jackson had designated the spot where the house
should stand was recalled by the General again in 1834 after the
fire when it was suggested to him that it might be rebuilt in another
location. Then he wrote to his adopted son: &ldquo;Was it not on the
site selected by my dear departed wife I would build it higher
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
up the hill;&rdquo; but the fact that Rachel had originally selected it
definitely settled in his mind any question as to whether the location
of the house should be changed.</p>
<p>In the interest of strict accuracy it should be pointed out that
the ground where the house stands is not quite so prairie-like
level as Parton describes it. On the contrary, it is on the side of a
gently sloping hill. The floor of the front portico is but one step
off the ground, whereas a flight of several steps is needed to
reach the back porch; and there is a quite perceptible rise of
ground between the entrance gate and the house.</p>
<p>Detailed and reliable information about the actual construction
of the original Hermitage on this site is peculiarly scarce.
In all the published Jackson correspondence there is but one
reference to the building operations, this being unfortunately
without date and merely referring to some difficulties encountered
in having the house painted. In a footnote in the published
&ldquo;Correspondence of Andrew Jackson&rdquo; Doctor Bassett mentions
having seen a receipted bill dated June 12, 1818, for $200 for
china and silver plate. Doctor Bassett says that it seems fair to
assume that this indicates an outlay for the new house, although
this is manifestly nothing more than speculation on his part. Most
of what we know today about the circumstances attending the
construction of the original building is mere surmise, based on
inferences and deductions. Jackson was a prolific letter writer;
but for some strange reason he seems to have written little or
nothing about the building of his new home. Also, unfortunately,
there is no information available as to the identity of the original
contractor or architect&mdash;if there was one.</p>
<p>It has been stated in published articles that the Hermitage was
built by an architect named Joseph Reiff; but the only foundation
for this seems to lie in the fact that he was the man in charge of
the rebuilding after the fire. Mr. Reiff, by the way, did not pose as
an architect at all. In the articles of agreement covering the rebuilding
he refers to himself simply as a carpenter; and it seems
likely that he was one of the class of men known in that time as
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
&ldquo;journeyman builders&rdquo;&mdash;practical carpenters who went about
the country equipped with books of plans of basic architectural
designs which they adapted to the needs of their clients. But, regardless
of what was his correct technical designation, there is
nothing whatever to connect Mr. Reiff with the original building
operation in 1819.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind the custom of the times, it is most probable
that the house was designed by Jackson himself and the actual
construction work done by skilled slave labor, perhaps under
the direction of some master builder. The design of the original
Hermitage was severely simple and had little about it to suggest
that its plans were drawn by a professional architect. It was not
at all beyond the capacity of General Jackson. The foundation
was of native limestone, quarried on the farm by slaves. The
poplar structural lumber and timbers, and the wide red cedar
boards for the porch floors, were cut nearby from local timber.
The walls were built of brick, burned on the place as was the
practice in those days. Brick making was still primitive in its processes.
A bed of clay was located, the top soil was removed and
lime sprinkled on the clay, and then a black boy on a mule had a
good time treading the lime into the clay and thus preparing the
raw material for the bricks, which were shaped in hand molds
and baked in improvised kilns.</p>
<p>By combining all the available information, it appears certain
that the original Hermitage was a simple two-storied, square
brick building consisting of four rooms and a hall downstairs
and the same arrangement upstairs. There was originally no
portico at the back or front, nor did the two wings then grace its
sides. It was just a square brick house, with no embellishments
or architectural pretensions. From references in letters it seems
that, as was common practice at the time, the house and its immediate
yard were enclosed in a picket fence, and there is substantiation
of this in one of the early prints of the Hermitage, but
there are no signs of such a fence today.</p>
<p>It was in this plain house that Jackson and Rachel lived for
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
ten happy years. He was not away from home much in those days.
He was elected to the Senate in 1823, but he soon resigned that
office. While he was in Washington, chafing under the time-wasting
deliberations of Congress, he wrote to John Coffee:
&ldquo;How often does my thoughts lead me back to the Hermitage.
There in private life, surrounded by a few friends, would be a
paradise compared to the best situation here; and if once more
there it would take a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> to remove me into
public life again.&rdquo; And he was sincere when he wrote that.</p>
<p>In 1831, after he had been inaugurated President, and while
he was living in the White House, General Jackson contracted to
have the Hermitage enlarged and elaborated in keeping with the
increased prestige of its master. Andrew, junior, had just married,
too, and the President probably wished to have the house
improved for the benefit of his new daughter-in-law, of whom he
was very fond. Accordingly, arrangements were made for the addition
of the two wings&mdash;that containing the dining-room and
pantry on the western side and the one embracing the library, or
office, the side entrance and the overseer&rsquo;s room on the garden
side of the house. It was at this time also that front and back
porticos were added; although, according to engravings made
at the time, the front portico was not then two stories high. It
merely extended across the front of the lower floor, with its roof
below the level of the upstairs windows, except at the front door
where it was two stories high with a pediment at the top. The
contemporary pictures also show the wings with gables at the
front and back, instead of with flat roofs as at present. This remodeling
work was done by a contractor named D. Morrison,
who had just finished building the stone tomb over Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s
grave in the garden.</p>
<p>Mr. Morrison wrote to President Jackson on December 6,
1831, announcing the completion of the work on the house and
giving some interesting details about the job. In this letter he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The additions and improvements are completed. In addition
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
to the improvements as exhibited in the plan I showed you, I have
erected a neat and appropriate portico on the back side of the
central building which adds very much to the comfort and convenience
of your dwelling. The Hermitage as improved presents
a front of 104 feet. The wings project 9 feet in front of the central
building and are connected by a collonade of the same breadth.
The collonade consists of 10 lofty columns of the Doric order,
the entablature carried through the whole line of front, and has
wreaths of laurel leaves in the frieze. The upper story consists of
a portico surmounted by a pediment which breaks the monotony
of the composition in a very satisfactory manner. The materials
employed in the improvements are all of the best quality the
neighborhood affords. The colonnade is covered with the best
copper, the sheets weighing from 12 to 14 pounds each sheet, and
the gutters that convey the water from front to back are also of
copper. The wing buildings and porticos are roofed with good
cedar shingles. The dining room is large and will dine 100 persons
at one time comfortably. The wing at the east end contains
the library, a large and commodious room; an overseer&rsquo;s room;
and a covered way that protects the three doors leading to the
library, overseer&rsquo;s room and to the back parlor. The old kitchen
is removed and the materials employed in the erection of a large
and commodious smoke-house which is placed on a line with
the new kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reference to the kitchen in Mr. Morrison&rsquo;s letter, by the
way, seems definitely to establish the fact that the present kitchen
and smokehouse were built in 1831 and were not parts of the
original establishment as built in 1819, as was for a long time
supposed. Exactly where the old kitchen stood is not revealed in
any records now available; but just to the east of the present
kitchen there may be seen in the grass the outlines of a stone
foundation which probably indicates its former location.</p>
<p>The total cost of the improvements made at this time was
$2,488.50, not including $131.00 paid out at the same time for
papering and painting the whole house. The itemized list of expenses
was as follows:</p>

<p>General Coffee, Jackson&rsquo;s old friend and fellow veteran of the
Battle of New Orleans and the Indian wars, drove over to the
Hermitage from time to time while the remodeling work was in
progress and kept an eye on it. On April 28, 1831, he wrote the
President at Washington: &ldquo;Your mechanics were at work on the
improvements making on the mansion house. I took the liberty
of suggesting some immaterial alterations in the addition, which
was approved of by the projector of the building, who said he
would consult you about it.&rdquo; This alteration in the plan, it is revealed
in one of Mr. Morrison&rsquo;s letters to President Jackson, consisted
in extending the eastern or library wing back twenty feet
further than called for in the original plan, the additional space
thus gained being used for the covered passage and overseer&rsquo;s
room. This overseer&rsquo;s room, also called the steward&rsquo;s room, was
in later years used as the nursery for the children of Andrew,
junior, and later the covered passage was bricked in and the side
entrance hall thus created as it is today.</p>
<p>Accurate and dependable pictures of the brick Hermitage as
it appeared in 1819 are singularly scarce, and the few available
efforts at its picturization differ considerably in appearance.</p>
<p>In one of Earl&rsquo;s early portraits of General Jackson the General
is shown standing on a slight eminence, with the Hermitage
at a distance in the background. This picture of the house, a veritable
portrait from life, is doubtless a trustworthy representation
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
of the original brick house; and there is presented herewith a reproduction
of this picture, obtained by successive enlargements
of the background of the Earl portrait. It ought to give a reliable
idea of the appearance of the place before the wings were added.</p>
<p>Similar in appearance is an undated engraving (&ldquo;Drawn and
engraved by H. B. Hall&rdquo;) which was reproduced in Bassett&rsquo;s
<i>Life of Andrew Jackson</i> and also in Marquis James&rsquo; <i>Border Captain</i>.
Presumably this was drawn by Mr. Hall on the spot, as it is
quite similar to the Earl picture showing the gabled roof and
double chimneys at each side of the house.</p>
<p>The most amusing and least accurate of all the available pictures
of the early Hermitage is to be found in <i>The Jackson Wreath,
or National Souvenir</i>, a laudatory book about Jackson, the President
elect, published in Philadelphia in January, 1829. In this
book is an attractive engraving of a suspiciously conventional
house which bears the descriptive entitlement: &ldquo;The Hermitage;&rdquo;
but faith in the accuracy of the picture is shaken by a naive footnote
(in microscopic type) which says with engaging candor:
&ldquo;On the commencement of this work, proper steps were taken
to procure a drawing of the Hermitage from the spot, by addressing
a prominent establishment at Nashville; whether the several
requests were ever received by them is not known, but the drawing
never came to hand here. A gentleman at Washington, intimate
with the grounds, politely furnished a description from
which a drawing was made. Anyone who is acquainted with the
difficulty of producing a correct drawing from description will
overlook any difference that may appear in the likeness to the
place it is intended to represent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This imaginative engraving shows a square house, with the
gable end in front, and with two single chimneys&mdash;one at the left
and one in the rear. There is also a neat little portico at the front
door, and an out-house close by the left-hand side of the house.
Despite its confessed inaccuracy it was obviously the source of at
least two other popular engravings of that day which reproduced
with fidelity its improperly placed gable and chimneys; and even
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
as late as 1855 as reliable a monthly magazine as Harper&rsquo;s illustrated
an article about Jackson with an alleged picture of the
Hermitage which was plainly but a copy of the engraving in the
&ldquo;Jackson Wreath&rdquo; with merely a few slight changes in the arrangement
of the conventionalized trees and horses in the foreground.</p>
<p>Fortunately there is preserved a contemporaneous picture, reproduced
in this book, which is generally accepted as a fairly accurate
representation of the house as it appeared after the wings
were added and before the fire. After the fire the front portico
was rebuilt two stories high all the way across; and the six large
columns as now seen replaced the smaller posts formerly used.
This picture, judging from the location of the tomb so close to
the house, is not free from the imaginative latitude the artists
sometimes allow themselves; but it is said to give a good idea of
the way the house looked before the fire.</p>
<p>In October, 1834, occurred the burning of the Hermitage, an
event that attracted widespread attention. Jackson was at that time
at the White House in Washington, but his adopted son and his
wife were occupying the Hermitage.</p>
<p>An account of the fire in a Nashville newspaper of October
14th announced the event in the following words: &ldquo;Yesterday
evening about 4 o&rsquo;clock the roof of the Hermitage was discovered
to be on fire, and all attempts to arrest the progress of the flames
proving unavailing, the entire edifice with the exception of the
room attached to the northern end and used as a dining room was
in a few hours consumed. The valuable furniture in the lower
story was fortunately saved, though much broken and otherwise
injured in getting it out. That in the second story, we understand,
was chiefly destroyed. The fire is supposed to have been communicated
to the roof by the falling of a spark from one of the
chimneys, and there being at the time a light breeze from the
northwest the progress of the flames was proportionately rapid.
The numerous and valuable private papers of the President were
probably all preserved. We need not add that the event has occasioned
to this community deep and universal regret.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>President Jackson was promptly advised of the fire in letters
from his adopted son; from Stockley Donelson, his nephew; and
from Colonel Robert Armstrong, postmaster at Nashville and
one of Jackson&rsquo;s strongest personal and political friends.</p>
<p>Stockley Donelson thus explained the origin of the fire: &ldquo;A fire
was kindled in the old dining room and the chimney caught on
fire, which not being observed immediately and the wind being
from the northwest, the fire was communicated to the roof. The
flame however had not spread very far before it was discovered
by Squire and Charles and the alarm given. Cousin Sarah was at
this moment in the house having just returned from a short ride
and Andrew was in the field, but a short distance from the house.
The fire was soon discovered by Wm. Donelson&rsquo;s hands who
were working near at hand, by A. J. Donelson&rsquo;s workmen and
hands, as well as by your own hands. They were all on the ground
before the roof fell in, etc. Mr. Rife by his own exertions succeeded
in getting on the dining room roof and extinguishing the
flames, etc. Others were employed in getting out the furniture,
etc., which was nearly all saved except some bedsteads upstairs.
I have made inquiry. I interrogated Mr. Rife and Mr. Hume who
were upstairs and in the old dining room where the fire was
kindled first and they both say it was not an unreasonable large
fire. The weather was very dry and windy. When the fire was
first discovered by Charles and Squire they made every effort to
get a ladder, but none could be found, and there was no other
way to get to the roof, etc. Cousin Sarah acted with firmness and
gave every necessary direction to save the furniture; and her and
Andrew, though much hurt, I am happy to add bear the misfortune
with fortitude.&rdquo; Mr. Donelson went on to say that the walls of the
house &ldquo;being originally well built are not much damaged&rdquo; and
that there would be no difficulty in rebuilding.</p>
<p>Colonel Armstrong in his letter was careful to say that in his
opinion the fire was &ldquo;purely accidental;&rdquo; and he estimated that
the house could be rebuilt on the old site for $2,000 or $2,500. He
recommended rebuilding on the old site (&ldquo;for I know the walls
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
and foundation were good&rdquo;), and volunteered to be of any possible
assistance.</p>
<p>The news of the burning of his home must have been a crushing
blow when it reached President Jackson in the White House.
Following the particularly turbulent session of Congress which
ended in June, 1834, the weary President had gone back to the
Hermitage and spent the summer there in the pleasant process of
recuperating from the debilitating effect of his long drawn out
battle over the bank. All of the administration&rsquo;s domestic problems
were settled, in one way or another; and he spent the summer in
riding about over the Hermitage plantation, visiting his friends
and neighbors, and entertaining the customary flow of guests.
Early in October he brought his vacation to an end and started on
his return to Washington; and he had hardly arrived back at the
White House before the letters reached him telling of the fire.</p>
<p>But Jackson accepted this blow of Fate with resignation and
equanimity. His letter to Andrew, junior, is a model of calm
fortitude under a sudden stroke of adversity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Andrew: I have this moment received your letter of the
13th instant giving an account of the unfortunate occurrence of
the burning of my dwelling. As no neglect is imputed to anyone
and as it appears one of those accidental occurrences where there
is no blame to attach to any one, we ought and I do meet it as an
act of Providence and always reconciled to His will and prepared
to say at all times and under all circumstances &lsquo;The Lord&rsquo;s will
be done,&rsquo; it was He that gave me the means to build it and He has
the right to destroy it, and blessed be his name. Tell Sarah to
cease to mourn its loss. I will have it rebuilt. Was it not on the
site selected by my dear departed wife I would build it higher up
the hill, but I will have it repaired. You say the walls are uninjured.
Let workmen be employed forthwith to repair it. Let
scantling and brick be got and have it covered in before the hard
frost with rain injures the walls. If tin can be got in Nashville
have a tin roof put on it. If the walls can be repaired and the
house covered in before winter the windows can be so closed as
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
to prevent the walls or scantling within from being injured. I
write to Col. Armstrong, whose letter is before me, who will aid
you in obtaining materials and workmen to cover in and repair
the house. I write in haste. Say to Sarah not to grieve or repine
about the loss. We will have it all repaired. I write to Mr. Toland
this evening to send on by the ship Chandler Price via New
Orleans as much tin as will cover a house 80 feet by 44 and hope it
will reach you in due time. This will enable you to borrow the
tin in Nashville from anyone who has it. I suppose all the wines
in the cellar has been destroyed, with Mrs. Donelson&rsquo;s box of
China. Give me as accurate an account of the loss of furniture as
you can at as early a period as possible. In all your bustle and improvement,
my son, have your cotton picked out and housed. It
becomes us now to act with economy and use industry to repair
and regain the loss. Therefore, as the only fund to aid in paying
for the land and repairing the building and other engagements
are the cotton crop, I urge you to have it carefully taken in, ginned,
baled and sent to market.&rdquo; As soon as the news of the fire became
known throughout the country there was set on foot in New
Orleans a movement to rebuild the Hermitage by popular subscription;
and a Nashville citizen, George C. Childress, wrote to
Jackson to ask him if such an action would be agreeable to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We see from the New Orleans papers,&rdquo; wrote Mr. Childress,
&ldquo;that a proposition is made in that city to raise a fund to rebuild
the mansion house at the Hermitage, every individual in the
United States who may choose to contribute fifty cents and no
more in order that it may be in the power of every man who may
wish to join in tendering to you this complimentary mark of public
gratitude and contributing to the repair and preservation of a
residence which is almost looked upon as National property.
There is no doubt that an ample fund would be raised in this
manner to rebuild the house in the most elegant manner and I
write, sir, to know if it would be agreeable to you to accept this
complimentary token of gratitude at the hands of your admiring
countrymen.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>This letter is found in Jackson&rsquo;s correspondence file, and on
the back of it is endorsed in the General&rsquo;s firm handwriting: &ldquo;Mr.
Childress to be answered: I respect as I ought the feelings that
dictated the generous feeling in the proposition, but can not accept
the boon. I am able to rebuild it, and hope whatever generosity
the good people of New Orleans intended to bestow on me
as a memento of their regard for my public services may be applied
to some charitable institution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing more clearly reflects Jackson&rsquo;s unquenchable spirit
than the prompt and effective manner in which he set about arranging
for the rebuilding of his home. His genius for organization&mdash;his
talent for getting things done, even at a long distance
from the scene of activity&mdash;here plainly manifested itself. &ldquo;Let
workmen be employed forthwith to repair it,&rdquo; he wrote Andrew;
and then he sat down and wrote to his friend, Colonel Armstrong,
asking him to get in behind the making of a contract for the rebuilding.
Apparently Colonel Armstrong called into consultation
another of Jackson&rsquo;s friends, Colonel Chas. J. Love, for in
January, 1835, Colonel Love wrote to the President that &ldquo;a contract
has been made with Messrs. Rife and Hume for the rebuilding
of the house at the Hermitage. Every care has been taken to
have the contract made so full and plain that it can not be misunderstood.
The materials are to be good and the work executed
in the best possible style. Mr. Hume is now up the country to
make engagements for the lumber that it may got down in time
to have it well seasoned before the work is put together&mdash;then
Colonel and myself will keep a strict lookout that the work is
done agreeable to contract. Colonel Armstrong and myself understand
the contract so well that it can not be misunderstood. It was
talked over and over again and agreed on not only in writing
but verbally, and all the alterations are to be made agreeable to
our view of them. The house is large and we got the best bargain
we could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Rife and Hume&rdquo; referred to in Colonel Love&rsquo;s letter were
Joseph Reiff and William C. Hume, the carpenter-contractors
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
who were then employed in constructing the handsome home
which General Jackson was having built near by, on the Tulip
Grove Farm, for his wife&rsquo;s nephew, Andrew Jackson Donelson.
Messrs. Reiff and Hume are mentioned in Stockley Donelson&rsquo;s
letter telling the news of the fire as having been in the Hermitage
at the time it started, and it is not improbable that they were
living there while the new house at Tulip Grove was being built.
It would have been characteristic of General Jackson to offer them
the hospitality of his home while they were engaged in the nearby
work.</p>
<p>The agreement for the rebuilding of the Hermitage was specifically
made out in the name of Andrew Jackson, junior, in deference
to the General&rsquo;s strong desire to have Andrew assume a
man&rsquo;s responsibility in the management of the estate; but the fine
Italian hands of Colonel Armstrong and Colonel Love are to be
seen in the careful phraseology of the document and the prudent
safeguards thrown about the carpenters&rsquo; performance. &ldquo;Col. Armstrong
and myself understand the contract,&rdquo; wrote Colonel Love;
and the published correspondence reveals how faithfully Colonel
Armstrong kept in behind the matter, watching all the details
of building and furnishing, and carrying the whole thing through
to completion.</p>
<p>The rebuilding agreement provides an interesting reflection of
the manner in which such activities were carried on a hundred
years ago, and as such is worth reproducing in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="lr">January 1, 1835.</span></p>
<p>Memorandum of agreement made and concluded upon this first day
of January, 1835, between Joseph Reiff and William C. Hume of the
one part and Andrew Jackson, Jr., of the other part, all of the County of
Davidson and State of Tennessee.</p>
<p>Article 1st. The said Reiff and Hume, (carpenters), have undertaken
to rebuild the Hermitage house and east wing of said house, to do
all the carpenters&rsquo; work of said house, and to find and furnish all the
lumber, plank, scantling, and nails, brads, sprigs, hinges, bolts and in
fact everything required to rebuild the same, except the glass, locks and
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
copper. The lumber, flooring, etc., etc., to be done of the best quality
and all well seasoned. The carpenters&rsquo; work to be done in the best and
most approved and workmanlike manner, for which the said Andrew
Jackson, Jr., agrees to pay the said Reiff and Hume in cash the sum of
$3,950, as the work progresses.</p>
<p>Article 2nd. The house to be rebuilt in the same order that it was
before, with four rooms and passage below and four rooms and passage
above. The garret rooms and the stairs from the garret to the walk on
the top of the house to be finished in a plain way. The walk on the
house to be the same mentioned in the plan and finished with a neat
and appropriate banister or railing. The joists in all the different rooms
to be bridged.</p>
<p>Article 3rd. Here follows an estimate of work and cost, and in case
any of it should not be done or should be abandoned a deduction is to
be made from the aforesaid sum of $3,800:</p>

<p>Article 4th. The main stairs to be circular, or geometrical, the work
to be done in the best and most approved style. A private staircase from
the room below called the steward&rsquo;s room to the chambers above, a folding
door in the rooms north as you enter the passage below, a door from
the room to the President&rsquo;s office, with a small passage spoken of by the
said Andrew not yet determined on. The front and back porch to be

such of the old ones as will answer for the upper story and furnishing
new ones for the lower, Reiff and Hume putting on all the locks.</p>
<p>Article 5th. The said Reiff and Hume agree to take and put into the
second story any of the old work saved that may be thought to serve to
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
answer and pay the value of the same. They also agree to take all the
lumber, plank, etc., that the said Andrew has now on hand as cash paid
in part of his contract.</p>
<p>Article 6th. It is hereby understood that the said Reiff and Hume
bind themselves to make a complete finish of the carpenters&rsquo; work of the
said building, pay all expenses of turning, using cedar timber where it
is necessary, the contract to be fulfilled agreeable to the plan given, and
to the express understanding made and agreed upon in the presence of
Col. Love and Robert Armstrong.</p>
<p>Article 7th. The dimensions of the rooms, the size of the windows,
and a minute description of work to be done is not mentioned in this

commence the work immediately, and further agree that the carpenters&rsquo;
work shall be so forwarded as to let the plasterers in to commence their
job by the first or middle of September next, so that the house can be
completely finished by 25 December, 1835.</p>
<p>As no contract has been made for the painting, the said Andrew
will have the priming done as fast as the work goes on.</p>
<p>It is understood that there is to be the same number of large fluted
columns in front as formerly if thought necessary, and it is further understood
that the said Reiff and Hume will do all and everything in relation
to the carpenters&rsquo; work of said building as though every item had been
separately specified, making a complete finish of the carpenters&rsquo; and
joiners&rsquo; work of said building, finding everything except the articles of
locks and glass heretofore mentioned.</p>

<p class="pcap">Sunday morning at the Hermitage Church in the early forties. General Jackson has just dismounted from his saddlehorse tied to
the tree in the right foreground, which tree is still standing. (From an old print.)</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>The work was got under way at once, but the building was
not declared completed until the summer of 1836&mdash;more than
eighteen months after the reconstruction was started. &ldquo;Hands can
not be got,&rdquo; Colonel Armstrong wrote Jackson during the summer
of 1835, &ldquo;still we are doing the best we can.&rdquo; It was the era
of inflation and easy money, and labor was scarce. So the work
dragged along; and, as is not unusual in building operations, the
cost of the finished job considerably exceeded the original estimate.
Colonel Armstrong in his first letter expressed the opinion
that the work could be done for $2,000 or $2,500; in a later letter
he said &ldquo;$2,500 or $3,000 will complete the whole work&rdquo;; the
contract with Reiff and Hume was at a figure of $3,950; and when
the final settlement was made the total was $5,125&mdash;not including
$900 for plastering and $400 for painting. To add to the
General&rsquo;s troubles at this time came a calamitous failure of the
cotton crop and he wrote sadly to Andrew about the necessity for
economizing. &ldquo;Unless the farm produces enough to pay its own
expenses, my means here will be fully exhausted in paying for
the finishing of the house and restoring to it the furniture destroyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were a few minor changes in the plans as the work progressed
including one suggested by Major William B. Lewis, Jackson&rsquo;s
closest political friend, who expressed the view that &ldquo;the
stories of the house should be made higher.&rdquo; Colonel Armstrong
wrote: &ldquo;I think it would be an improvement and add very much
to the appearance of the house.&rdquo; On this subject General Jackson
wrote to Andrew: &ldquo;I would be satisfied to see it restored to what
it was before it burnt, but as I know I shall not be long on earth
to enjoy its comforts in retirement, I enclose his letter on this
point to you that you may exercise your own discretion.&rdquo; Major
Lewis carried his point; the stories were made higher. Also during
the course of the work, at the suggestion of the helpful Major,
some changes were made in the size and arrangement of the windows.
The new windows, he wrote Jackson, &ldquo;are of very pretty
size and proportions, and will look much better than the old
ones.&rdquo; He added that in his opinion the house as rebuilt would
be a great improvement over the old one, both in interior arrangement
and exterior appearance.</p>
<p>At last, on August 2, 1836, Colonel Armstrong rendered to
General Jackson a final statement of the expense of rebuilding:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The house is well built and convenient and in appearance
greatly improved upon the old one,&rdquo; Colonel Armstrong wrote
Jackson upon its completion; and so the old General found it
when he returned to the Hermitage in June, 1836.</p>
<p>When the fire occurred Andrew, junior, and his family went
to live temporarily at the nearby Hunter&rsquo;s Hill place, but later
took a house in Nashville. In November, 1834, Mrs. Jackson and
the children went to Washington to spend the winter in the White
House, with interspersed trips to Philadelphia to visit her family
and buy furniture for the Hermitage, but Andrew stayed in Nashville
to look after the rebuilding work. He joined Sarah and the
children for a vacation with the President at the Rip Raps in July
and August, 1835, but he came back to Nashville in September.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h2 id="c3">III: RESCUE AND RESTORATION</h2>
<p>Those who believe in special dispensations of Fate affecting
human affairs must feel that there has ever been
watching over the Hermitage some kindly guardian angel
to protect it from the wasting touch of time and especially to
frustrate the numerous and varied efforts that have been made to
utilize it for some purpose which would have made it impossible
to maintain it as a national shrine for patriotic Americans.</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson had been dead hardly ten years before it was
proposed to convert his old home into a military school. Immediately
following the War Between the States, during the Reconstruction
period, it was suggested that it would be an ideal
location for a home for Federal soldiers. Later it was selected as
the proper place for a Confederate veterans&rsquo; home. Then some
misguided persons wanted to establish a reform school and penal
farm there. Still later a movement was started to convert the plantation
into a model farm for educational purposes. These were
but a few of the plans advanced for making use of the Hermitage;
but in every instance a benevolent Providence intervened and
helped to preserve it as simply the home of the patriotic old
pioneer Tennessean whose burning love for his country transcended
every other emotion.</p>
<p>When General Jackson died in 1845 he left the entire Hermitage
estate to his adopted son, Andrew Jackson, junior. When
the old General made his last will in 1843 one of his closest
friends, Major W. B. Lewis, who felt no restraint in volunteering
his advice, offered the suggestion that for the protection of the
interests of the adopted son&rsquo;s wife and children it might be advisable
to leave a part of the estate to them in some such way as
to insure their continued comfort and security &ldquo;in case his son&rsquo;s
speculations should continue to be unsuccessful.&rdquo; But Jackson&rsquo;s
sense of loyalty to his adopted son was so great that he refused
to entertain this suggestion. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said firmly, &ldquo;that would
show a lack of confidence in Andrew;&rdquo; and, pointing to his wife&rsquo;s
tomb in the garden, he continued: &ldquo;If she were alive she would
wish him to have it, and to me her wish is law.&rdquo; But the General&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
loyalty did not exceed his frankness, and in the preamble of his
will he sets forth the lamentable fact that &ldquo;my estate has become
greatly involved by my liabilities for the debts of my well-beloved
and adopted son, Andrew Jackson, Jun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The exact condition of Jackson&rsquo;s estate at the time of his death
was set forth in detail in a communication from a Nashville citizen
which was printed in a daily paper in 1889: &ldquo;At the death of
General Jackson he owed but two debts of any magnitude, one
of them $15,000 to Frank Blair of Washington, the other to General
Planchin of New Orleans. His estate consisted of the Hermitage,
then containing about 1,200 acres, on which he had about
100 negroes besides stock of all kinds. Besides this he owned his
plantation in Mississippi which the adopted son and heir afterward
sold with the negroes then on it for $40,000. This left the
Hermitage, with the negroes and all else on it, clear and free after
paying the $21,000 of debt, with a surplus of $19,000 in cash.
So, to sum it all up, the estate at the General&rsquo;s death was worth,
clear of debt, somewhere near $150,000. This was well known
by those near him and was generally believed by the community.
It has been repeatedly stated by his opponents that the General
was deep in debt when he died in 1845, if not insolvent. This is
a great mistake, as I have endeavored to show from the facts here
given, which are from my own knowledge received from my intimate
business relations with the adopted son and heir, Andrew
Jackson, Jr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson, junior, in retrospect presents rather a pathetic
picture. As the President&rsquo;s adopted son he had every opportunity
before him; but apparently the germ of success was simply not
in him. General Jackson lavished affection and attention on him
throughout his childhood and youth, and a real son could not
have been reared more tenderly. &ldquo;I have no doubt he will take
care of us both in our declining years,&rdquo; the General wrote Rachel
in 1813. And in 1832 he wrote an old friend that &ldquo;Andrew is
now married and I mean to throw the care of the farm on him.
I shall never more pester myself with this world&rsquo;s wealth.&rdquo; But,
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
somehow or other, something always seemed to be going wrong
with the things to which Andrew gave his attention. All accounts
agree in describing him as exceptionally amiable and engaging
in his personality; he was well educated, being a graduate of the
old University of Nashville; he was charming socially; he was
beloved and venerated by his family&mdash;but he seemed unable to
develop the rugged aggressiveness and forcefulness of his illustrious
namesake, and gradually the estate bequeathed him by General
Jackson slipped between his fingers. Cholera took off 26 of
his slaves in one year; another year there was a calamitous crop
failure; ill-advised kindness led him to endorse friends&rsquo; notes&mdash;with
the usual result; and an unwise business venture cost him
the $15,000 he had invested in it.</p>
<p>An estate of $150,000 was a notably large bequest back in 1845;
but by 1853 the heir&rsquo;s fortunes were so shrunken that he was reduced
to the necessity of mortgaging the Hermitage to secure a
$15,000 debt, and in 1856 he was forced to the sad extremity of
placing the estate on the market&mdash;having already sold off all of
the land except 500 acres.</p>
<p>Naturally, the first prospective purchaser to whom the historic
property was offered was the State of Tennessee. In fact, General
Jackson seems to have foreseen some such contingency and before
he died had told his son that if ever it became necessary for
him to sell the Hermitage he should first offer it to his native
state. The offer was made, and the state General Assembly passed
the following act authorizing its purchase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas, it is good policy in a republican government to encourage
the habits of industry and to inculcate sentiments of veneration for those
departed heroes who have rendered important services to their country
in times of danger; and</p>
<p>Whereas, Tennessee acknowledges no superior in feelings of patriotism
and devotion to the Union in whose cause the lamented Andrew
Jackson acquired so much distinction; therefore</p>
<p>Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Tennessee that
the governor of the state be empowered and it is hereby made his duty
to purchase for the State of Tennessee 500 acres of the late residence of
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
Andrew Jackson, deceased, including the mansion, tomb and other
improvements, known as &ldquo;The Hermitage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Be it further enacted that whenever the said purchase is made and
the title to said property secured to the state that the governor is hereby
authorized to cause the bonds of the state to be issued and to endorse
the same in an amount not exceeding $48,000, the proceeds of which
to be appropriated by him to carrying into effect the provisions of this
act: Provided, that the governor and the secretary of state upon investigation
shall be satisfied said price is not exhorbitant.</p>
<p>Be it further enacted that the governor of the state be authorized and
required to tender the said property to the General Government of the
United States upon the express condition that it be used as a site for a
branch of the Military Academy at West Point; and in the event the
General Government does not accept the tender thus made in two years
from the expiration of this session of the General Assembly, then the
governor shall be authorized and required to have fifty acres laid off,
including the tomb, mansion and the spring and the spring houses, and
expose the balance to public sale either as a whole or in lots, on time or
for cash as to him may seem best, and make his report to the legislature
of 1859-1860.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew Johnson was governor of the state at this time and
was the sponsor of the plan to tender the Hermitage mansion
and grounds to the Federal government as a site for a branch of
the military academy. In due season he made the tender as instructed,
and in 1857 the Committee on Military Affairs of the
United States Senate, through Tennessee&rsquo;s Senator James C. Jones,
accepted the offer. But the war clouds were gathering. There was
mounting sentiment in the North against a federal military school
in the South. Thus, Tennessee retained title to the historic property.</p>
<p>The price the state actually agreed to pay Andrew Jackson,
junior, for the property was $50,000; but Mr. Jackson was to continue
to occupy it for two years beyond the time of the sale, and
so the state held out $2,000 in lieu of rent. Tennessee may not
have been willing to recognize any superior in patriotism and devotion
to General Jackson, as so eloquently expressed in the enabling
act, but she was not above driving a hard bargain with
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
his adopted son. Mr. Jackson, in accordance with the terms of the
trade, remained at the Hermitage until 1858 and then removed
to Mississippi.</p>
<p>From 1858 to 1860 the Hermitage was without an occupant,
and suffered as tenantless houses usually suffer. There was nothing
further said about using it as a military school, nor was there
any agitation of the plan to offer it for sale &ldquo;as a whole or in lots.&rdquo;
Fortunately for coming generations of American citizens, the
property remained intact; but the old house stood there vacant
and decaying until 1860 when Isham G. Harris, the new governor
of Tennessee, sent to Mississippi to request Mr. Jackson to return
and be its custodian. Mr. Jackson had not been especially prosperous
in his new home, and he was glad to return and re&euml;stablish
himself in the Hermitage as &ldquo;tenant at will.&rdquo; His household
at this time consisted of himself and wife, his daughter Rachel,
his two sons, Andrew and Samuel, his wife&rsquo;s widowed sister Mrs.
Adams and her three sons.</p>
<p>When Tennessee cast her lot with the Southern Confederacy
in July, 1861, it did not take long for the young men of the Hermitage
household to join the Confederate forces. Five brave-hearted
young soldiers walked out the broad front door of the
Hermitage, mounted their horses and rode off to the front. Only
one returned. Andrew, III, who had been educated at West Point,
was commissioned colonel of the First Tennessee Heavy Artillery,
and he was the lone survivor after four years of war, more
than half of which was spent in prison at Camp Chase. Samuel,
a captain, was killed at Chickamauga and lies buried in the family
burial plot in the Hermitage garden. None of the Adams boys
survived the war. One was in the Confederate Navy, one was a
casualty at the siege of Vicksburg, and the other died in Kentucky
fighting with General John Morgan.</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson, junior, with his wife and daughter and Mrs.
Adams remained at home in the Hermitage and watched the waves
of the war roll back and forth around them. In 1862 after the fall
of Fort Donelson (named, incidentally, for Daniel A. Donelson,
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
a general in the Confederate Army and a nephew of Mrs. Rachel
Jackson), Nashville fell into the hands of the Federal troops and
was never regained by the Confederates. During the Federal occupation
of Nashville and the surrounding country, General George
H. Thomas placed a cavalry guard over the Hermitage to protect
it from damage or despoliation; and to this thoughtful foresight
on General Thomas&rsquo;s part may be attributed the fact that the old
home of Andrew Jackson did not suffer the fate of so many other
historic houses in the South during the four years of war.</p>
<p>In April, 1865, Andrew Jackson, junior, stepped finally from
the stage where he had played such a sad and ineffectual r&ocirc;le.
Just a few days after the news of Lee&rsquo;s surrender reached the
Hermitage he accidentally shot himself while hunting, and died
the next day. Perhaps the summons of death was not entirely
unwelcome to this saddened and impoverished old man, who had
spent his last days as a guest in the decaying old home amid whose
pristine splendor he had been the petted and pampered son of
its distinguished and honored master. Again the words of the
funeral service were heard in the Hermitage parlors, and friends
bore his remains to the little graveyard in the corner of the garden.
Here he sleeps, with his sons at his side, close in the shadow
of the monumental tomb of the great man who adopted him, who
gave him his name and who strove so earnestly to make another
Andrew Jackson of one in whose veins flowed none of the red
Jackson blood.</p>
<p>Mrs. Sarah York Jackson, with her son Andrew, and her sister
Mrs. Adams, remained at the Hermitage in the combined position
of custodian and guest of the State. The daughter, Rachel,
had married Dr. John M. Lawrence and removed to a nearby
farm. The state, apparently, forgot that it owned the historic old
mansion; and, as the occupants&rsquo; means were limited, it gradually
deteriorated. Soon after her husband&rsquo;s death Mrs. Jackson held
an auction at which were sold the furnishings of the dining room.
These were bought, for the most part, by neighbors and residents
of Nashville; and when the Hermitage was rescued and reclaimed
most of this furniture was restored to its original place either by
purchase or by gift. Mrs. Jackson died in 1887 and she was succeeded
as custodian by her son who, in the same year, married
Miss Amy Rich, a native of Ohio who was teaching school in
the neighborhood.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>From time to time, as the years went by, various suggestions were
advanced with reference to making some use of the Hermitage
property, but none of them gained much support or aroused much
interest. For two decades after 1865 most of the efforts of the
state of Tennessee were in the direction of recuperating from the
ravages of four years of war, and no serious consideration was
given any plan for doing anything definite with the Hermitage.
Things just drifted along, with the old mansion house gradually
taking on an increased shabbiness, weeds and sprouts springing
up in the once well-kept lawn, and other signs of deterioration
increasing.</p>
<p>Finally, however, in 1888 affairs were brought to a head by a
proposal that the house and farm be converted into a home for
Confederate soldiers. This movement gained instant popularity,
and so great was the appeal of the idea that it was generally considered
that when the state&rsquo;s General Assembly met in 1889 some
action would be taken to convert the Hermitage into a soldiers&rsquo;
home.</p>
<p>It was then, as a sort of emergency defensive measure, that the
Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association was hastily organized; and too
much can never be said in tribute to the work done by this association
in saving Old Hickory&rsquo;s home from misuse or destruction.
The idea of an organization of women to preserve and beautify
the old place seems to have originated in the mind of Mrs. Amy
Jackson, wife of Colonel Andrew Jackson, III, inspired by the
successful experience of the Mount Vernon Association in rescuing
Washington&rsquo;s home on the Potomac; and she quickly enlisted
the aid of kindred spirits who worked with a fervor and tenacity
worthy of Andrew Jackson himself until they had accomplished
the desired end.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>The people of Tennessee, naturally and justly, had a feeling of
veneration and devotion for the Confederate veterans; and it required
courage to appear before the public in the r&ocirc;le of opposing
the soldiers&rsquo; home movement. Colonel and Mrs. Jackson, however,
had associated with them in their apparently hopeless task
some tireless and enthusiastic workers. There was Mrs. D. R.
Dorris of Nashville, whose husband was a newspaper man and
who was herself an accomplished publicist; there were Mr. and
Mrs. William Alexander Donelson, Mr. Donelson being a son
of Andrew Jackson Donelson, General Jackson&rsquo;s ward, secretary
and friend. From the time of Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s conception of the
idea of a memorial association, these zealots never relaxed their
vigilance nor abated their efforts; and it is primarily due to them
and their far-seeing vision and untiring enthusiasm that the Hermitage
is today preserved for all the world as a historic shrine.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jackson was not a native of Tennessee, and after she got
the ball started to rolling she took but little active part in the promotion
work following an initial brush with a group of the Tennessee
legislators whom she sharply charged with a lack of veneration
for Old Hickory&rsquo;s memory. They promptly retorted with
mumbled but fervent invective against damned Yankees impeding
a movement for a Confederate veteran&rsquo;s home; and she
was wise enough then to withdraw from the controversy, which
bade fair to become heated. Colonel Jackson, himself a Confederate
veteran, was invulnerable to any possible criticism as to
a lack of love for the South, and he proved a tireless worker in
the cause. Mrs. Dorris worked day and night and kept up a barrage
of publicity in the newspapers which was of inestimable
value in swaying public sentiment; and Mr. Donelson, with considerable
of the diplomacy and political shrewdness inherited
from his distinguished father, set himself to work at the task of
pledging sufficient votes from the members of the Assembly to
save the Hermitage.</p>
<p>Gradually the merit of the proposal gained for it new supporters
among the prominent people of Nashville. Mass meetings
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
were held; the newspapers rallied to the cause. One by one, opponents
in the Assembly were won over, until at last a majority
was assured. But even then, the final result was a compromise. It
was the original desire of the ladies to acquire the house and the
entire estate, and the statement was boldly made that they were
not looking for a gift, that they wanted to buy the property from
the state&mdash;although they themselves were not quite sure just how
they were going to buy anything when they didn&rsquo;t have any
money. At last, however, it was agreed&mdash;after long and sometimes
stormy debate&mdash;that the state would retain the larger part
of the farm (475 acres) and erect a special building on it for the
soldiers&rsquo; home, granting to the women&rsquo;s organization control of
the Hermitage mansion house and twenty-five acres of ground,
including the garden, with the injunction to &ldquo;adorn, beautify and
preserve&rdquo; it.</p>
<p>It was a great disappointment to the ladies when they got only
the relatively small tract of twenty-five acres immediately adjacent
to the house; and through the following years the association never
lost sight of its original aim. In 1923 its tenacity of purpose was
first rewarded by having the General Assembly of the state convey
to the board of trustees an additional 232&frac12; acres of the original
tract, to the end that the association &ldquo;be permitted and encouraged
to preserve and beautify same, so as to display the respect,
love and affection which a grateful state and people cherish
for their illustrious hero and statesman, Andrew Jackson.&rdquo; It was
stipulated at the time of this conveyance, however, that there
should be no interference with or infringement on any of the
rights or uses of the land then held and used by the Confederate
soldiers&rsquo; home so long as the home should continue to exist. But
in 1934 the number of inmates in the home had dwindled to
eleven, so these few tottering old men were transferred to another
state institution; and then all the remaining acres were turned
over to the management of the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association.
Thus, at last, the association achieved its original aim to have the
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
whole property under its direction&mdash;the mansion house and the
entire 500 acres.</p>
<p>The state in its conveyance of the property adopted the excessive
precaution of providing for the creation of a board of nine
trustees (male in gender), these to be commissioned by the governor
upon the recommendation of the association. This, it will
be recalled, was back in 1889 before the days of equal suffrage,
when the activities of mere women were supposed to require the
strong guiding hand of a masculine supervisory body; but, be it
said to their everlasting credit, the trustees have tacitly taken the
position that their powers and duties are purely nominal and
honorary. The legal title to the property rests in them; but the
administration and management are vested in the ladies&rsquo; organization,
and whatever credit is due for the rescue and preservation
of the Hermitage is distinctly to be attributed to the unflagging
labors of the patriotic and devoted women who have constituted
its membership and corps of officers since it was organized.</p>
<p>The Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association was formally organized on
May 15, 1889, under a charter that had been granted on February
19th of that year. At the organization meeting directors were
elected and the association was definitely launched as an active
body with Mrs. Nathaniel Baxter as its first regent. Following
the example of the Mount Vernon Association, it was planned to
make the organization truly national in its scope by appointing
vice-regents in every state of the union. Accordingly an impressive
list of vice-regents was made up, including such distinguished
women as Mrs. Grover Cleveland, Mrs. Potter Palmer, Mrs. A. K.
McClure and others, who, it was hoped, would be interested in
the movement. The hope that women in other states would join
in the work, however, proved to be without foundation; and the
women of Tennessee soon reconciled themselves to the realization
that whatever was done would have to be done without outside
assistance.</p>
<p>Although the promoters of the association were successful in
their efforts to prevent such use of the Hermitage as would destroy
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
the possibility of maintaining it as an historic shrine, the
state was strangely reluctant and niggardly in carrying out its part
of the deal. In substance, the state transferred to the ladies&rsquo; association
the responsibility of managing the property; but did not,
at that time, appropriate one cent for its maintenance. In 1895
the state, in a burst of belated generosity, appropriated $50 per
month for the upkeep of the Hermitage. This was increased to
$1,200 per year in 1911, to $1,800 in 1915 and to $2,000 in 1919,
at which later figure it now remains; but for its whole life the
Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association has been to all intents and purposes
entirely self-supporting, and in raising funds for the purchase
of the original furniture and historic relics it had no financial
aid whatever from the state.</p>
<p>Immediately after acquiring the property the association broadcast
an appeal to the American public for funds; which appeal,
printed in booklet form, was given the most widespread distribution.
After reciting the fact that the association had been entrusted
by the state with the management of the property, the
booklet stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The association proposes to keep in continual repair the house, tomb
and grounds; for many years nothing has been done in this regard.
There is consequently great need for a repair fund, and the first money
collected into the treasury will be devoted to restoring to its original
beauty the grand old historic mansion, the tomb, and to adorning the
grounds. The association also wishes to purchase the relics and furniture
now at the Hermitage and owned by Colonel Andrew Jackson, and
which have been pledged to said association. These relics are both
valuable and interesting, and a large sum of money will be required to
purchase them. It will be readily seen that to put the homestead in
thorough repair, to purchase the relics, to create an endowment fund
by which the association is to become self-sustaining, a large sum of
money will be required. The association is national in its character, as
Andrew Jackson was national in his reputation. He belonged to the
people, and to them the association now appeals for assistance in this
great work. The by-laws require a membership fee of one dollar; by
this means the association hopes to realize at least $150,000, as it is the
belief that there are fully that many citizens of the United States who
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
would gladly give that sum to the restoration of Old Hickory&rsquo;s home.
Contributions are invited of any sum from one dollar or less to any great
sum a munificent benefactor may be willing to give. We hope that this
appeal will strike the keynote of patriotism and that in a very few years
the home of Andrew Jackson, the beautiful Hermitage, will be the
Mecca of all true patriots in the United States, and of historic interest
to the touring stranger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the eloquence of this fervent appeal and the sanguine
expectations expressed, the effort to enlist financial support was
signally ineffective and devoid of results. All the true patriots,
so confidently invited to join in the movement, seemed fully willing
to let somebody else pay for restoring of Old Hickory&rsquo;s home.
No munificent benefactor stepped forward to volunteer the donation
of any great sum. To their pained surprise and chagrin, the
ladies were forced to the conclusion that they themselves by their
own efforts would have to raise the money needed. And so they
fell to work at the proverbially hopeless task of pulling themselves
up by their own bootstraps.</p>
<p>In 1889 the association must have viewed the task ahead of it
with something akin to terror: A tumble-down house, a neglected
and weed-grown lawn and garden, dilapidated fences and out-houses&mdash;and
an empty treasury. Window-panes were broken out;
the woodwork had not known the touch of a paint-brush for forty-five
years; the stately columns were rotting and awry; window
shutters were off their hinges, flapping in the wind; the roof
leaked so badly that the plastering was falling off the walls and
ceiling; the wallpaper was hanging in tatters; the old dining-room
was used as a place for storing sacks of wheat, with space
left for General Jackson&rsquo;s old carriage; the rear lawn had been
plowed up and cultivated. Here was a rehabilitation job of sickeningly
great proportions&mdash;and the fledgling organization did not
even have enough cash in hand to start grubbing up the young
elm and mulberry sprouts that covered the front lawn.</p>
<p>But the ladies, buoyed up by their zeal and devotion, never
lost heart. They would not permit themselves to be discouraged
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
at the magnitude of the task confronting them. By dint of holding
entertainments and concerts and balls and resorting to other
money-making expedients they slowly accumulated enough to
begin the work of making the most immediately necessary repairs.
It was an Herculean task, and the marvel is that they had the
courage and pertinacity to attempt it and stick to it in those early
days when financial help was so hard to get.</p>
<p>One of the earliest sources of revenue for the association was
the staging of excursions to the Hermitage. This was before the
days of good roads and automobiles and the place, located twelve
miles from the center of Nashville, was distinctly inaccessible.
There was a railroad station two miles from the house, and the
plantation&rsquo;s steamboat landing was located just back of the soldier&rsquo;s
home building three miles away.</p>
<p>The first excursion was made by way of both rail and steamboats
from Nashville, and was given on the occasion of the annual
meeting of the National Educational Association in that
city in July, 1889. This was the very first activity of the new organization,
and it was on this occasion that the Hermitage was
first thrown open as a public institution. &ldquo;Pleasure wagons&rdquo; met
the trains and steamboats and transported the visitors to the house;
and during the four days&rsquo; session of the educational association
more than a thousand people drove up the driveway, bordered
with its towering cedars, and visited Old Hickory&rsquo;s old home.</p>
<p>A noteworthy feature of this first official visitation of the Hermitage
by the public was that just before the first wagon-load of
pedagogical excursionists drove up to the front door of the mansion
house there was born there the last of the Jackson name ever
to be given birth within the walls of the Hermitage. The new
arrival was named Albert Marble Jackson, in honor of the president
of the educational association; and a committee of the visiting
educators with a flourish presented the little fellow with a
primer, placing his baby hands upon it when he was but a few
hours old. All of the visiting ladies, of course, had to pick up
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
the new baby and cuddle it; and his old nurse never tired of recounting
the fact that after the visitors had gone poor little Marble
was &ldquo;as red as a beet&rdquo; from all the manhandling he had received
during the day. Not until he had been given a sedative
(in the form of a mild toddy) was he finally sung to sleep that
night, after as strenuous a day as any new-born baby ever experienced.
It was this baby, grown to be a handsome young man,
who had the honor of unveiling Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s bust in Statuary
Hall in the Capitol at Washington in 1928.</p>
<p>Another promotional activity of the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association,
launched in 1890 and continued until recent years, was
the brilliant ball given each year in celebration of Jackson Day&mdash;January
8th, the anniversary of the Battle of New Orleans. An
interesting feature of this ball each year has been the lighting,
for only a few seconds, of the historic candle found in Lord Cornwallis&rsquo;s
tent at the time of his surrender. The candle was presented
to General Jackson during the height of his fame and was
one of his most prized possessions. He made it a practice during
his lifetime to light it briefly on every Eighth of January, and it
was in honor of this ceremony of his that the practice was perpetuated
in the Jackson Day balls. This old candle, brown with
age, is one of the many interesting things to be seen now in the
museum at the Hermitage.</p>
<p>When the Hermitage property was turned over to the association
in 1889 it was in such a state of decay that it was hard to
determine just where to start the work of repair. The roof was
leaking, the woodwork needed painting, the wallpaper was hanging
in shreds on the dampened and moldy walls. One of the first
works of restoration involved the repair of the hand-painted
scenic wall paper that adorned the lower hall. This paper was
threatened with complete destruction when the ladies&rsquo; association
took over the management of the property; and an expert
wallpaper man spent two weeks repairing it and putting it back
in place. At the same time the wall paper all over the house was
restored and renovated, as it was considered a matter of primary
desirability and importance to preserve the original paper which
had been selected by General Jackson and sent to the Hermitage
when it was rebuilt in 1835. An excellent job of restoration and
repair was accomplished, this being particularly noticeable in one
of the guest rooms on the second floor. The paper in this room,
in the old-fashioned block design, showed recurring bunches of
roses; but the dampness of the walls had caused large patches of
it to fall away and be lost. An artist was employed who so skilfully
reproduced the design in fresco on the wall that it is today
hard to see where the paper ends and the painting begins.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Again in 1930 the scenic paper in the hall was the subject of
preservative treatment at the hands of one of the world&rsquo;s foremost
experts in this kind of work. Skilfully the paper was removed
from the walls, which were then lined with canvas. The
canvas was then covered with plain white paper, on which was
mounted the scenic paper. Due to the ravages of time and the
petty vandalism of misguided souvenir hunters some small parts
of the paper were missing, but these were carefully reproduced
and the lower hall now presents the same gay appearance it did
when President Jackson came home from Washington in 1836
to inspect his rebuilt and refurnished home.</p>
<p>During the early days limited funds necessarily restricted the
work that could be done; but as the years went by the income
gradually increased, and each succeeding regent of the association
took pride in performing some necessary part of the work
during her administration.</p>
<p>In 1907 the association received its greatest single gift of money
from an outside source&mdash;an appropriation of $5,000 from the
United States government. It was during this year that President
Roosevelt visited the Hermitage, and he immediately became
much interested in its attractiveness and importance as a national
shrine.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt was a genuine admirer of Andrew Jackson.
In his book about the War of 1812 he said that &ldquo;Jackson is
certainly by all odds the most prominent figure that appears during
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
this war;&rdquo; and later in the same book he says that Andrew
Jackson &ldquo;with his cool head and clear eyes, his stout heart and
strong hand, stands out in history as the ablest general the United
States produced from the outbreak of the Revolution down to the
beginning of the great Rebellion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an informal address delivered on the occasion of his visit
to the Hermitage, President Roosevelt complimented the ladies&rsquo;
organization on what it had done to preserve it &ldquo;as a place of
national pilgrimage for all citizens who wish to learn, to study,
who wish to quicken their patriotism in the present by visiting
the abode, the living place of one of the great patriots of the
nation&rsquo;s past.&rdquo; With his customary impulsiveness he then and
there declared that he would see to it that the national government
made a contribution to the expense of maintaining what he
described as &ldquo;the home of one of the three or four greatest public
men that any nation has developed in the same length of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his very next message to Congress President Roosevelt said:
&ldquo;I solemnly recommend to the Congress to provide funds for keeping
up the Hermitage, the home of Andrew Jackson, these funds
to be used through the existing Hermitage Association for the
preservation of the historic building which should be ever dear
to America.&rdquo; Honorable John Wesley Gaines, then a member of
the board of trustees of the Hermitage was the representative in
Washington of that Congressional district of Tennessee affectionately
known as &ldquo;the Hermitage District;&rdquo; and he promptly introduced
a bill following the recommendation of the President,
which bill soon passed, granting $5,000 to the association. This
money was utilized in making some highly desirable improvements
about the place, foremost of which was the enlargement of
the caretaker&rsquo;s cottage so as to render unnecessary his occupation
of any part of the house. The Hermitage then, for the first time,
was open in its entirety to visitors.</p>
<p>The chief source of revenue of the association is the admission
fee charged at the door of the house; and as thousands of visitors
pass through the broad front door every month, the income from
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
this source is not inconsiderable. At first a fee of ten cents was
charged, the amount being made small since there was really but
little to see except the bare house and it in a sadly run-down condition.
This fee, however, was increased to 25 cents in 1899, after
some of the original furniture had been installed, and at this
figure it has remained.</p>
<p>The funds derived from the admission fees are augmented by
the sale of pictures, pamphlets and souvenirs. A few years ago an
unusually severe storm blew down a number of century-old cedar
trees that had been planted by General Jackson himself along the
driveway; and from these fallen trees has been obtained a supply
of wood from which may be supplied novelties for a long time
to come.</p>
<p>Naturally one of the first aims of the association was to acquire
from Colonel Andrew Jackson, III, the furniture and the personal
relics of General Jackson which he had inherited and which he
still had in the house. This furniture constituted the original furnishing
of the old house, placed there by General Jackson himself,
and included the bed on which he died and the appurtenances
of his room just as he had left them. All these furnishings and
relics had been left to Colonel Jackson by his mother, and it was
the desire of the association to preserve them intact and keep them
in their original place.</p>
<p>Colonel Jackson was agreeable to the sale, and gave the association
a four-year option on them at a price of $17,500; but the
finances of the organization were totally inadequate to handle a
deal of such proportions at that time. Accordingly a compromise
arrangement was made whereby Colonel Jackson and his wife
were retained as custodians of the property, and the association
agreed to pay them at the rate of 3% on the agreed value of the
furniture and relics. The state had retained the tillable part of the
farm, and Colonel Jackson could not look to that as a means of
support; and although the struggling association could not keep
up its payments to him with any degree of regularity, thereby
working a hardship and inconvenience on him, he permitted the
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
option to remain in force until July, 1893, hoping that the organization
would be able to raise the necessary funds. An effort was
made to get the state to appropriate $15,000 for this purpose, and
the governor sent a special message to the General Assembly
recommending the appropriation. But the watchdogs of the state
treasury could not see any political juice to be squeezed out of
such a measure, and they proceeded to make spread-eagle orations
about the folly of spending a small fortune for relics when there
was so much &ldquo;practical good&rdquo; that could be done with the money.
So the appropriation was defeated, and upon the expiration of
the option Colonel Jackson and his wife removed from the Hermitage,
taking with them all its furnishings and leaving only the
bare walls.</p>
<p>With the Hermitage left bare and unoccupied, the ladies were
confronted with the acute problem of what to do with the historic
mansion they had worked so hard to get. Uncle Alfred, the
ancient retainer of the Jackson family, remained in his cabin, the
sole vestige of life on the place; but it was out of the question to
expect this tottering old black octogenarian to care properly for
so valuable a piece of property. For want of some more expedient
means of immediately meeting the difficulty, the regent and
secretary of the association planned temporarily to occupy the
house themselves until suitable permanent arrangements could
be made. A few simple pieces of furniture were installed, a cook
was engaged to prepare their meals, and bravely the two ladies
assumed occupancy of the deserted house.</p>
<p>The first day passed pleasantly enough, but the gathering
shadows of night, when they were left alone in the house, suddenly
brought home to the ladies a sharp realization of their
lonely situation. They retired early and went to sleep, but they
were awakened during the night by an unearthly din&mdash;from the
pantry came the sound of crashing pans and dishes, there was a
sound of chains being dragged across the upstairs hall, there was
a noise like a war-horse being ridden headlong through the upper
rooms. In short, there were all the standard evidences of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
real, old-fashioned ghost! The second night brought the same experience&mdash;and
then, for some reason or other, the regent and the
secretary officially decided that it would be wise to engage a
regular caretaker to look after the property, and they discreetly
returned to their homes in Nashville.</p>
<p>So a man was employed who was a combination carpenter and
gardener and handy man, and for the next two years work was concentrated
on improving the appearance of the place, especially in
the garden. Then in 1895 a young farmer of the neighborhood,
Mr. T. L. Baker, was engaged as caretaker, and he and his wife
moved onto the premises and took charge. At this writing Mr.
Baker is still the custodian, and the appearance of the Hermitage
and grounds today is to a great extent a tribute to his faithful
and efficient work.</p>
<p>Despite all its early discouragements, the association never
lost sight of the fact that the most important thing before it was
the restoration to the Hermitage of the original furniture and
relics still in the possession of Colonel Jackson. Without them
the house was just an empty shell. In 1897, while the Tennessee
Centennial Exposition was being held in Nashville, Colonel Jackson
wrote to the association suggesting that they buy and exhibit
at the exposition the historic old Jackson family carriage. After
some dickering the coach was purchased for $100 and put on display
at the exposition, where it attracted much attention. It is now
to be seen in the carriage house at the Hermitage, and constitutes
one of the most interesting features of the display there. Visitors
who drive to the Hermitage in their automobiles from all parts
of the country seem fascinated by the clumsy-looking old coach
with its high wheels, denoting muddy roads, but with its pink
satin lining, indicating that it was a vehicle of quality.</p>
<p>The purchase of the old carriage served to reopen negotiations
with Colonel Jackson, and from that time on the association continued
to purchase the furnishings piecemeal until there had been
acquired all the original furniture and most of the relics desired.
With the aid of Mrs. Rachel Jackson Lawrence and Uncle Alfred,
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
both of whom were familiar with the arrangement of the furniture
in the early days, every piece was put in its original and
proper place. Today the Hermitage stands unique in being the
country&rsquo;s only national shrine which is fitted throughout with the
original furnishings, which gives an authentic impression of the
exact conditions under which its famous occupant lived his everyday
life.</p>
<p>Wisely enough, the first purchase of furniture made by the association
embraced the bedroom furnishings of General Jackson&rsquo;s
own room&mdash;the bed, dresser, washstand, couch, table, chairs,
fender and andirons, all the portraits and the carpet. The price
paid was $1,000. The furniture used in the downstairs hall was
next purchased; and then, room by room, as the money became
available, the purchases were continued until all the rooms were
equipped with their original furnishings.</p>
<p>In 1894 one of the most important improvements was made
when a modern heating plant was installed which eliminated the
damage caused by excessive dampness within the house. The heating
plant is now located at a safe distance from the building, for
the purpose of reducing the fire hazard to a minimum. In fact, the
most painstaking precautions have been employed to prevent fire.
The house is not wired for electricity, and no artificial lighting of
any kind is used. The place is closed to visitors when the light of
the sun fades in the late afternoon. Danger from fire originating
within the building seems to have been entirely eliminated; and
as the caretaker&rsquo;s home and outbuildings are at a safe distance
from the house, the probability of fire being communicated from
that source is remote.</p>
<p>By the narrowest of margins the Hermitage escaped from the
blighting hand of those who would have made of it a military
academy, a reform school or a state institution, or in some other
way prevented its being maintained as a place where admiring
American citizens may go and admire the memory of the man who
lived there during the history-making days of his dramatic career
in public life. But today, thanks to the diligence of a little handful
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
of far-seeing zealots of forty years ago whose patriotic devotion
has been the inspiration of those who have so faithfully
worked to bring their dream to fulfilment, the Hermitage is preserved
in perpetuity as a shrine to which the footsteps of admiring
thousands have beaten paths from all over the nation.</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson was a meteoric figure in the life of the country;
he was the first to give actuality and realization to the theory that
the most humbly born individual might aspire to and reach the
President&rsquo;s chair. Well did President Roosevelt say: &ldquo;His career
will stand evermore as a source of inspiration for boy and man in
this republic,&rdquo; and it is a priceless privilege that patriotic fathers
may bring their sons to the stately old home of the grand old man
who wore his patriotism as a flaming badge and who knew no
motive more impelling than his passionate love for his country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<h2 id="c4">IV: DESCRIPTION OF THE HOUSE</h2>
<p>When the wrought-iron gates swing back on the cut-stone
pillars at the entrance to the driveway leading
up to the Hermitage front door they leave an opening
that is a tight fit for an entering automobile, although it was
amply wide for the carriages in vogue a hundred years ago when
it was built. Anyhow, this front entrance is not open to automobiles
now&mdash;the ladies concluded that the trees were being jeopardized
by the visitors&rsquo; cars&mdash;but, nevertheless, the Hermitage
makes its most impressive appearance when approached from the
front.</p>
<p>The house is situated back about a hundred yards from the
county road, and is reached by a beautiful tree-lined driveway
in the shape of a guitar. This driveway was built in 1837, when
the Jacksons returned from the White House, and its design was
suggested by Mrs. Sarah York Jackson. The ever-ready and versatile
Earl drew the plans for it, and he and the General superintended
the actual construction work. The General took particular
interest in it and personally looked after the planting of the cedar
trees on both sides of it. The driveway curves up to the step leading
onto the portico, shaded by two splendid old holly trees, and
here the visitor of today enters at the same place as did the guests
of General Jackson in the early part of the Nineteenth Century.</p>
<p>The floor plan of the Hermitage, as will be seen from the accompanying
sketch, was a convenient and commodious one.</p>
<p>Crossing the broad front portico, floored with flagstones
quarried from the native limestone, and entering through the
beautifully detailed double front door, the visitor finds himself
in the wide central hall, running from front to back, a feature so
much in favor in Southern architecture on account of the free
ventilation thus afforded. The most immediately striking architectural
feature of the hall is the superb circular staircase which
sweeps in a perfect curve of beauty to the second floor. Whoever
designed and built this stairway, craftsman though he may have
been, had the soul of an artist combined with the brain of a mathematician,
for every feature of it is so carefully planned and built
that there is never a flaw in the flowing grace of its inspiring upward
spiral sweep.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>To the left of the hall are the double parlors, separated with
folding doors, and each with its doorway into the hall. Each of
the parlors has a handsome marble mantelpiece, the one in the
front being made from marble quarried in Italy while that in the
rear is made from native Tennessee marble. The crimson damask
curtains at the windows were ordered by General Jackson in
Philadelphia in 1836 when the Hermitage was refurnished, the
color being specified because his wife had always preferred it.
The piano in the back parlor is one bought by General Jackson
for his little granddaughter, Rachel, soon after he retired from the
Presidency. &ldquo;Would my baby like to take music lessons?&rdquo; he
asked her one day; and when she answered in the affirmative he
sent her mother to town to buy her a new piano&mdash;the old one
wasn&rsquo;t good enough for his little pet. The old piano was sold in
1865 when the adopted son&rsquo;s widow disposed of some surplus
furniture, the purchaser being a neighboring farmer who confided
that he expected to use it to hive bees. There is also to be
seen in the back parlor a handsome mahogany center table which
has an interesting history. When General and Mrs. Jackson were
entertained in New Orleans in 1815, following the battle, the
handsome furnishings of the room where they were entertained
were presented to them and shipped up the river to the Hermitage
when they returned. Most of this presentation furniture was
burned in 1834, but this old table survived. On the mantel in the
back parlor is General Jackson&rsquo;s favorite clock, with its hands
stopped at the hour of his death. All the furnishings of the parlors&mdash;the
chairs, mirrors, chandeliers, draperies, carpets, vases, divans,
etc.&mdash;are part of the Hermitage&rsquo;s original furnishings, and are in
the places they occupied when General Jackson was alive. The
crystal chandeliers are especially impressive. They seem to hang
rather low&mdash;but they were placed there in the days when candles
were used for lights, even before the later days when the primitive
tapers were replaced with the modern sperm-oil lamps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>A doorway leads from the front parlor into the dining room
wing, and there is also a door into the dining room from the
broad front portico. To the rear of the dining room are the pantry
and storeroom, with a passage leading to the semi-detached
old-fashioned kitchen in the rear.</p>
<p>In the dining room is to be seen the massive mahogany sideboard
purchased by Mrs. Jackson in New Orleans when she and
the General were returning from Florida, together with the table,
chairs and other original furnishings of this room. Here also is
displayed most of the Hermitage silverware, including the silver
formerly belonging to Commodore Decatur, engraved with his
coat of arms, which was purchased from his widow by Jackson in
1833 when she was in reduced circumstances. The General bought
from Mrs. Decatur for $350 her china and silverware, but he presented
the china and two silver fruit baskets to Mrs. Emily Donelson,
giving the remainder of the silver to &ldquo;my daughter, Sarah
Jackson.&rdquo; When Commodore Decatur was killed in his duel with
Captain Barron it left his wife in financial distress. One of her
impatient creditors brought suit against her which, to use her own
words, &ldquo;frightened all the trades people with whom I have any
little dealing and makes them more pressing for payment;&rdquo; and
the General&rsquo;s check for $350 gave her very welcome relief.</p>
<p>The dining-room fireplace is featured by the celebrated Eighth
of January mantelpiece, a rustic affair built of pieces of rough
hickory by one of Jackson&rsquo;s veterans of the Battle of New Orleans
who made it as a monumental labor of love, working on it all by
himself and working only on successive anniversaries of the battle
until he got it finished on January 8, 1839. The General entered
into the spirit of the thing and installed it in this room, with suitable
ceremonies, on January 8, 1840. It is now in a rather dilapidated
condition, thanks to the depradations of souvenir hunters
in the early days before the present iron railing was built.</p>
<p>The floor in the dining room is a reproduction, the only floor
in the house not original. This room, however, had been used for
years as a storeroom when the association took over the property
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
and the flooring was ruined. An oak floor was laid to replace it;
but in 1931 this was removed and a floor of wide poplar boards
was built to correspond with the original. All the floors in the
house are made of poplar, except the porch floors which are native
Tennessee red cedar and which constitute a striking tribute to the
durability of this wood.</p>
<p>In the broad central hall downstairs there is seen on the walls
the celebrated pictorial wall paper, bought for the new house in
1836. Mrs. Rachel Jackson Lawrence, the General&rsquo;s granddaughter,
is authority for the statement that similar paper was
used in the hall before the house was burned, and she was fond of
recalling that the paper for this hall had to be bought three times:
The first time from Paris, during Mrs. Rachel Jackson&rsquo;s lifetime;
and the two purchases that had to be made to get the paper
on the walls in 1836. In the refurnishing of the new Hermitage
most of the purchases were made in Philadelphia by Mrs. Sarah
York Jackson; acting, of course, under the General&rsquo;s suggestions
when he had any to make. Accordingly in January, 1836, a shipment
of furniture and furnishings was made from Philadelphia,
the invoice covering which included the pictorial paper ordered
from Paris: &ldquo;3 sets of fine paper hanging, Views of Telemachus,
@ $40, $120.&rdquo; But the steamboat on which these furnishings were
being transported, the <i>John Randolph</i>, was burned at the wharf
at Nashville on March 16, 1836 (with the loss of three lives);
and only a part of the boat&rsquo;s cargo was saved. At a sale of the salvage,
probably through error, the crate containing the paper,
along with a lot of other stuff, was sold to Mr. W. G. M. Campbell
who had just finished building a new home on his farm on
the Lebanon Road near Nashville. Surviving members of Mr.
Campbell&rsquo;s family state that he did not know what was in the
crate when he bought it, simply buying it &ldquo;sight unseen&rdquo; along
with other salvage from the burned steamboat. The inescapable
inference from the preserved correspondence is that Jackson&rsquo;s
Nashville factors, Yeatman and Company, who owned the <i>John
Randolph</i>, tried to recover the paper after they discovered that
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
it had not been damaged by the fire so as to render it unfit for use;
but, it seems, they were thwarted by Mr. Campbell who resorted
to the expedient of pasting the paper on the walls of the parlor of
his new house before starting to argue about it. The Campbell
descendants today affirm that they never heard that there was any
argument about it, and that all there was to it was that Mr. Campbell
bought it at public sale, paid for it and used it&mdash;a strictly
legitimate and above-board transaction. But on May 27, 1836,
Colonel Armstrong wrote General Jackson in some heat as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I send you enclosed a note addressed to me by the Messrs.
Yeatman after a conversation I had with them this morning. They
have always been ready and willing to do all in their power to get
back the paper from those who purchased it. When I called on
Campbell I expected to get the paper; that night he cut it and put
it on the walls. Williams is not at home. I saw Shelly, who will do
nothing. He is not disposed to restore it. Williams dare not, as his
wife claims it; so I called on the Messrs Yeatman and stated the
facts, who willingly proposed to purchase another set. I did not
present Andrew&rsquo;s note to them enclosed to Colonel Love, but
suggested in their letter to draw on them for the amount. My dear
sir, when you have this whole matter explained it will give you a
pain to find men so lost to all honorable feelings as to retain that
which does not belong to them. It is a theft. The person who you
got the other set from will draw on Messrs. Yeatman or myself on
sight and the draft will be paid. Send it out as soon as possible, so
that we may complete the house. Major Eaton will be with you in
a few days and will explain this unpleasant affair and the treatment
received. Yeatman will sue for the real value of the paper.
He thinks he has been badly treated by Williams and Campbell.
He offered them any profit in advance if that was their object.
Let me request you to send out the other without delay, as I want
to see the house complete before Mrs. Jackson and yourself get
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Armstrong&rsquo;s letter is tantalizingly incomplete in details,
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
and there is no other written reference to this &ldquo;unpleasant
affair;&rdquo; nor is there any inkling as to the identity of the Williams
and Shelly mentioned.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, the paper was hung on the walls of the Campbell
parlor and is there today, although it is now covered with
two layers of modern wall paper put on to satisfy the taste of
modern tenants of the old Campbell homestead who objected to
the faded grandeur of the old hand-painted paper imported from
Paris and wanted something bright and new.</p>
<p>Promptly upon receipt of news of the original paper&rsquo;s fate,
General Jackson wrote to his friend Henry Toland in Philadelphia
and ordered a duplicate set. This paper, manufactured by
Dufour in France and imported by Toland, is the paper that is
on the walls of the downstairs hall today, attracting the admiring
glances of all visitors.</p>
<p>This paper depicts the familiar story from mythology of the
adventures of Telemachus on the island of Calypso while on his
journey in search of Ulysses. There are four scenes in the paper:
No. 1, the landing of Telemachus on the island, showing the
queen advancing to meet him; No. 2, Telemachus, with Mentor
beside him, relating to Calypso the story of his travels; No. 3, the
fete given by Calypso in honor of the visitor; No. 4, Telemachus
leaping from the cliff after the maidens of the island had burned
his boat upon learning of his resolution to escape.</p>
<p>Midway of the downstairs hall, on the right-hand side, is the
door to a cross-hall which leads to the side entrance on the east
or garden side. On either side of this little hall are doorways
leading to the downstairs bedrooms; and the entry hall at the side
is flanked on the left by a small room formerly used, first as the
overseer&rsquo;s or steward&rsquo;s room and later as a nursery, and now serving
as the museum. On the right is General Jackson&rsquo;s library or
office which has a door leading to the front bedroom (which was
the General&rsquo;s) and another door opening on the front portico,
corresponding to the similar door at the other end of the porch
which affords entrance into the dining room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>Perhaps the most interesting room of all is that front bedroom,
the old General&rsquo;s room, just as it was the day he died. There is the
high old four-poster bed, with its heavy canopy and with its little
steps at its side, the bed on which he breathed his last. There is
the couch by the window on which he spent so much of his time
during the latter years of his life. There is his chair, his dressing
gown, his tobacco box; and there above the mantel is the portrait
of his much beloved Rachel, placed where his eyes could see it the
first thing in the morning and the last thing at night while he
lived and where the last flickering glance of his closing eyes rested
the day he died. Two windows look out on the front porch,
and it was by these windows that the plantation&rsquo;s slaves gathered
and waited weeping while he gasped out his last few breaths.
Also it was through one of these windows that the old man leaped
one night when he awoke suddenly and found his room filled with
smoke. A spark had popped out of the fireplace and set fire to his
big chair, but he thought that the house was afire and fled precipitately,
calling for help. Here is a room redolent with memories
of the old General; it is no wonder that visitors linger at its doorway
longer than at any other spot in the whole house.</p>
<p>The room immediately across the side hall was originally
known as &ldquo;Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s room&rdquo; and was used as a family sitting
room, before the wings were added. At that time the present back
parlor was used as the dining room, and the front parlor was
known as the portrait parlor, being the room in which all the portraits
were hung. In 1832 this back bedroom was refurbished to
be used by Andrew Jackson, junior, and his wife as their room. &ldquo;It
will be more convenient than upstairs,&rdquo; the General wrote Andrew
when suggesting this use of the room&mdash;and perhaps he also
looked ahead to the time when the adjoining little room would
be useful as a nursery.</p>
<p>The office or library, adjoining General Jackson&rsquo;s bedroom,
might well be said to have been the center of political activity of
the United States for thirty years. History was made in this room.
Presidents were made and unmade, Cabinet officials and other
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
high dignitaries had their fate decided there. Here are the furnishings&mdash;the
bookcases, desks and chairs&mdash;just as they were in
those days. One feature that might strike the visitor is that there
are not so many books in evidence as one might expect to find in
the library of the President of the United States. Less than 1,000
volumes are in the cases. Andrew Jackson was a man of action
rather than reading, but the books he possessed (many of them
gifts of admirers and of proud authors) indicate that he had a
widely diversified taste for good literature and that he was not a
stranger to classical and studious reading.</p>
<p>The Hermitage bookshelves show a library of which nobody
need feel ashamed. Here are Shakspeare&rsquo;s works, the poems of
Byron and Burns and Dryden, Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress and theological
works alongside the novels of Smollett and Fielding. Here is
Johnson&rsquo;s Dictionary, and an early Encyclopedia Americana; the
Spectator, the Rambler; early American novels, notably those of
William Gilmore Simms and Charles Brockden Brown; here are
Horace and Virgil in translation&mdash;and a burlesque Iliad. Memories
of his war on the Bank are recalled by the numerous treatises
on banking and currency; and one is reminded of his military days
by a copy of the Infantry Regulations, dated 1812, along with a
number of books referring to the War of 1812. There is a complete
array of medical books for the home&mdash;necessary in those
days before the telephone and automobile made doctors so immediately
accessible; and his practical knowledge of stock breeding
is indicated by the books on the veterinary science and the other
aspects of animal husbandry. Here is young Andrew&rsquo;s copy of
Robinson Crusoe, also some of his schoolbooks; and a sentimental
touch is provided by a calf-bound copy of Burns&rsquo; Poetical Works
on the flyleaf of which is inscribed &ldquo;To Rachel Jackson, from her
beloved husband, And^w Jackson.&rdquo; Also reminiscent of Rachel is
a flower gardening guide, with quaint old illustrations. There
are bound volumes of Niles&rsquo; Weekly Register, there are the Madison
Papers and the American State Papers, some law books of the
early days&mdash;in short, it is the library of a country gentleman and
statesman of a century ago.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>Here in his office, aside from his books, we find his old walnut
desk, used throughout his life from the time he was a practicing
attorney; the mahogany tables; candlesticks and lamps. It is the
workshop of the statesman, just as he left it nearly a century ago.</p>
<p>In a cabinet on one side of the room are a number of bound
volumes of newspapers of Jackson&rsquo;s day, which recalls the fact
that he was an omnivorous reader of the newspapers and periodicals
current in his time. His postage account with the Nashville
postoffice in 1825 shows that he received regularly the following
papers: <i>Washington City Gazette</i>, <i>Florence Gazette</i>, <i>American
Farmer</i>, <i>Louisville Public Advertiser</i>, <i>National Journal</i>, <i>National
Chronicle</i> (daily), <i>Niles Register</i>, <i>Columbian</i>, <i>Louisiana Gazette</i>,
<i>Kentucky Gazette</i>, <i>Baltimore Morning Chronicle</i> (daily),
<i>Jackson Gazette</i>, <i>Knoxville Enquirer</i>, <i>Allegheny Democrat</i>, <i>Mobile
Commercial Register</i>, <i>National Republican</i>, <i>Knoxville Register</i>
and <i>Florida Intelligencer</i>&mdash;all these in addition to the Nashville
papers. One wonders how he had any time at all for reading
books!</p>
<p>The little room to the right of the side entrance was originally
designed for an overseer&rsquo;s room, but was later used as a nursery
for the children of Andrew, junior. Now it provides an admirable
place for the display of the many interesting Jackson relics
accumulated by the Ladies Hermitage Association. Here is a
wonderful array of historical and personal relics&mdash;the General&rsquo;s
swords and pistols (also his prayer book and silver communion
cup); his gold spurs, epaulettes and stirrups, and his dress suit;
Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s lace cap and veil; specimens of the White House
silver, china and cut glass; the famous candle taken from the tent
of Cornwallis; medals; jewelry; letters and documents&mdash;an intensely
interesting collection of memorabilia pertaining to the
vivid career of the Hermitage&rsquo;s master. Literally hours may be
spent in this room profitably and pleasantly.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>The hall between the library and museum was originally an
open entry, but was enclosed when the rebuilding was done. The
closet on the right-hand side of the hall, under the stairway, was
added after General Jackson&rsquo;s death, but the left-hand closet was
original. This was used in the old days to store the cotton goods
made by the plantation spinners before it was doled out to the
sewing women. Every year in the late fall the negroes were called
up to the overseer&rsquo;s room to be given their winter clothing, and
this occasion was always seized upon by the negroes for a big celebration.
A plantation slave orchestra, composed of fiddle, tambourine
and bones, would make music while the negroes were
coming and going and everybody&mdash;black and white&mdash;always had
a big time on these occasions.</p>
<p>Going upstairs by way of the back stairway there is to be found
on the right a bedroom that was used by the boys brought up on
the place&mdash;Andrew Jackson, junior; Andrew Jackson Donelson
and Andrew Jackson Hutchings. On the left is the bedroom occupied
so long by Ralph E. W. Earl, the artist who married one of
the nieces of Mrs. Jackson and who, upon his wife&rsquo;s early death,
was taken in as a permanent member of the Hermitage household.</p>
<p>The arrangement of rooms upstairs is similar to the downstairs
of the central part of the house&mdash;a broad central hall, running the
full length of the house, with two bedrooms on each side of it.
This hall has doors at front and rear opening onto the upstairs
back and front porticos; and its walls are covered with a hand-painted
duplicate of the scenic paper downstairs. This duplicate
paper was painted by Miss Jennings for use in the replica of the
Hermitage which stood on the exposition grounds at the St. Louis
World&rsquo;s Fair in 1904. After the exposition closed it was brought
back to Nashville and placed in its present location, where it provides
a pleasing complement to the original paper in the lower
hall.</p>
<p>On the western side of the upstairs hall the back bedroom was
used as a guest room (and it was seldom empty); and the front
bedroom is officially labeled &ldquo;The Lafayette Room,&rdquo; probably
because it was in the corresponding room in the old Hermitage
that the Marquis de Lafayette spent the day when he visited Jackson
in 1825, ten years before the present Hermitage was constructed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>The fire in 1834 destroyed much of the furniture then in use in
the house, and it was replaced with goods purchased in Philadelphia.
Jackson left the selection of the furnishings to Mrs. Sarah
York Jackson, his only suggestion in connection with the furniture
being that she order beds with plain posts instead of carved
ones as they would be easier to keep clean. This admonition accounts
for the severely plain bedsteads to be seen throughout the
Hermitage.</p>
<p>This new furniture was shipped in coastwise vessels to New
Orleans, and thence by river steamboats to Nashville. There
seems, for some reason, to be a strange conflict of erroneous
opinions about the origin of the furniture used to furnish the new
Hermitage. Some have stated that it was imported directly from
France. At one time it was persistently reported that Jackson took
the White House furniture to the Hermitage when he retired from
office in 1837. The records clearly indicate, however, that the
furniture was bought in Philadelphia through Jackson&rsquo;s agent
there, Henry Toland, and consigned by Toland to Maunsel
White, Jackson&rsquo;s New Orleans factor, with instruction to send it
up the river to the Hermitage. The total value of the new furniture
was $2,303.77, divided among seven Philadelphia merchants.
A specimen bill for furniture from one house, showing the values
prevailing at the time, was as follows:</p>

<p>All the goods mentioned in the above invoice arrived safely in
New Orleans, but when they were reshipped on river steamboats
to Nashville a large part of the goods was lost when the <i>John
Randolph</i> burned at the wharf in Nashville on May 16, 1836.
The <i>John Randolph</i> carried eighteen crates of the new Hermitage
furniture, including the famous Telemachus paper, and this
loss coming close on the heels of the loss of his house must have
been sorely discouraging to the old man. But he promptly, upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
receipt of the bad news, wrote Andrew to check up the bills of
lading and let him know just what parcels were burned so that
he could reorder them in Philadelphia. His letter closes on a
pathetic note: &ldquo;This catastrophe will make it necessary that I
should have more means, and in one of my letters I said to you to
inquire whether the tract in the Western District, or part of it,
could be sold and for what. You told me some time ago that there
was a man would give five dollars per acre for 400 acres. If you
can get that for it in cash I authorize you to sell it. You can say
with truth that I had declined taking that offer for it because it was
too low; but the burning of my house, and now my furniture,
makes it necessary for me to sell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The General&rsquo;s worst fears were realized insofar as he was perturbed
about the inability of his resources to absorb the loss of
his home and furniture. Soon after his return from Washington
he wrote to a friend: &ldquo;I returned home with just ninety dollars
in money, having expended all my salary and most of the proceeds
of my cotton crop; found everything out of repair, corn and
everything else to buy for the use of my farm; having but one
tract of land besides my homestead, which I sacrificed and which
has enabled me to begin the new year clear of debt, relying on
our industry and economy to yield us a support, trusting to a kind
providence for good seasons and a prosperous crop.&rdquo; To another
friend he wrote, complaining that he had to buy bacon for his
family and also corn and oats for the stock&mdash;an unforgivable
thing to a practical farmer. Furthermore, upon his return he
found &ldquo;the new roof of my house, just rebuilt, leaking and to be
repaired.&rdquo; Continuing he said: &ldquo;I carried $5,000 when I went to
Washington&mdash;it took all of my cotton crop ($2,250) with my
salary, to bring me home. The burning of my house and furniture
has left me poor.&rdquo; A few days after his return he said: &ldquo;I find my
blooded stock in bad order and too numerous for empty corn
cribs and hay lofts. I have determined to sell out part to enable me
to feed the balance better.&rdquo; In the spring of 1838, anticipating a
needed vacation at a health resort during the approaching summer,
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
he was trying to sell off some town lots he owned in Alabama,
admitting frankly that unless he could sell the lots he
would not have the means to make the desired trip to the springs.
It was at this time that he wrote: &ldquo;To wind up our debts since last
spring we have paid upwards of $7,000. Andrew was inexperienced,
and most men are likely to become swindlers when an opportunity
offers, and he happened to fall into the hands of men
who pretended to be friends and trusted too much to their honesty.
But, thank God, we are not now in debt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But in the midst of his adversity we find him writing unselfishly
to Andrew Jackson Donelson: &ldquo;I heard you say that your means
to buy corn was exhausted. Inclosed I send you half of my present
means after paying for my corn, oats and fodder engaged. This
half Eagle ought to buy you three barrels of corn. It will buy
20 bushels of oats, which will be better for your colts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c5">V: THE GARDEN AND GROUNDS</h2>
<p>Much of the sentimental interest attached to the
Hermitage centers around the garden, that fenced-in
acre to the east of the mansion house which was set
aside by General Jackson for that purpose when the Hermitage
was built in 1819. We know that the exact site of the house was
carefully selected by his wife, and it is safe to assume that it was
she also who picked out this particular spot for the garden.</p>
<p>A short time before the Hermitage was built the General, accompanied
by Rachel, visited in Washington on official business;
and on this occasion they made the pilgrimage to Mount Vernon.
Jackson was obviously much impressed by his visit to the old
home of George Washington, so much so that he left in his papers
a written memorandum of his impressions aroused by his journey
to what he described as &ldquo;the venerable dwelling of the patriarch
of our liberties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is only a speculation, of course, but it is interesting to entertain
the fancy that it was perhaps as a result of this visit that the
old General, upon his return to Tennessee, decided to build for
himself a home more in keeping with the dignity of the position
he had attained as a national hero. Perhaps Rachel herself suggested
it to him. She was proud of the General and the distinctions
he had gained; maybe she put the thought in his head that the
Hero of New Orleans ought not to be receiving his guests in a log
house, that he should live in a little more style&mdash;something approaching
the quiet dignity of Mount Vernon, which they both
admired. A new house they should have&mdash;and, of course, by all
means, a garden.</p>
<p>At any rate, we find in the old General&rsquo;s memorandum of his
Mount Vernon trip the following reference: &ldquo;A neat little flower
garden, laid out and trimmed with the utmost exactness, ornamented
with green and hot houses in which flourish the most
beautiful of the tropical plants, affords a happy relief to the
solemn impressions produced by a view of the antique structure
it adjoins, and leads you insensibly into the most delightful
reverie, in which you review in imagination the manner in which
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
the greatest and the best of men, after the most busy and eventful
life, retired into privacy and amused the evening of his days.&rdquo;
And so, when the Hermitage mansion house was built in 1819, we
find close by its side &ldquo;a neat little flower garden, laid out and
trimmed with the utmost exactness;&rdquo; and, although it is difficult
to picture the tempestuous old warrior puttering about a flower
garden, his correspondence reveals that thoughts of it occupied a
part of his attention throughout his lifetime, and contemporaries
have recalled that he had more than the average man&rsquo;s interest in
the flowers, particularly admiring the roses and the pinks.</p>
<p>That the garden was no mere afterthought or casual incidental
to the building of the house is shown by the fact that in 1819 he
engaged, evidently for the task of laying it out and planting it,
an English professional gardener named William Frost, reputed
at that time to be one of the best gardeners in the metropolis of
Philadelphia. The best was none too good for Rachel in those
days.</p>
<p>During his long absence from home during his two terms as
President, Jackson&rsquo;s correspondence is liberally sprinkled with
references to his garden. In all the great difficulty he experienced
in obtaining the services of competent or satisfactory overseers,
one of his criticisms of them was that they were derelict in their
care of the garden&mdash;Rachel&rsquo;s garden. And in May, 1835, when
his son wrote him relative to the good conduct of the new overseer
most recently engaged he replied: &ldquo;How I am delighted to
hear that the garden has regained its former appearance that it
always possessed whilst your dear mother was living, and that
just attention is now paid to her monument. This is truly pleasing
to me, and precisely as it ought to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In May, 1832, in a letter to his son&rsquo;s young wife General Jackson
wrote: &ldquo;I sincerely regret the ravages made by the frost in
the garden, and particularly that the willow by the gate is destroyed.
This I wish you to replace. The willows around the tomb
I hope are living, and a branch from one of these might replace
the dead one at the garden gate. It will grow if well watered and
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
planted on receipt of this.&rdquo; But it didn&rsquo;t grow&mdash;or else the youthful
Sarah neglected to plant it; and it was not until 1925 that a
member of the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association ran across this
letter of the General&rsquo;s and decided that, better late than never,
his wishes should be carried out. The willows at the tomb&mdash;the
willows General Jackson had himself planted nearly a century
before&mdash;are now dead and gone, probably crowded and shaded
to death by the stately old magnolias that now guard the plot of
graves. But a scion was taken from another willow on the place
and today the young willow may be seen there at the garden gate,
belatedly replacing the one destroyed by the late frost in the
spring of 1832.</p>
<p>The garden plot occupies an acre of ground, surrounded by
a high picket fence built of enduring Tennessee red cedar. The
fence is of the old substantial type, constructed of pointed pickets
mortised with precision into the horizontal sustaining members,
and entrance is gained through an old-fashioned wooden gate,
reached by a short brick walk from the door on the eastern side
of the house.</p>
<p>Inside the garden, eight feet from the fence, the plot is encircled
by a gravel walk about six feet wide, and similar bisecting
walks cut the garden into four plots. In the center the walks converge
on a geometrically designed system of concentric circular
beds in which annuals bloom from year to year. Roses climb on
the fence, and shrubbery is planted along the sides of the walks,
the central portion of each of the four plots now being kept in
grass. In the middle of the north side is the original brick tool
house, the path to which is shaded by an old rustic rose arbor; and
peeping out between the box bushes and crape myrtles may be
seen an occasional moss rose or other old-fashioned plant.</p>
<p>We do not find here the hothouses with their tropical plants
which the General and Rachel so much admired at Mount Vernon;
but evidently an effort was made to introduce unusual shrubbery
into the garden, for in addition to the customary plants
found in a Southern garden of the period there are to be seen
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
some of the more rare and exotic shrubs&mdash;fig trees brought from
the far South, a pink magnolia from Japan, etc.</p>
<p>The planning and arrangement of the planting is such that it
provides attractions the whole year round. There are flowers
throughout the blooming season from early spring to late fall;
then there are the brightly colored leaves of the bushes and trees;
and during the winter there is the glossy green foliage of magnolias
and the faintly scented box bushes beside the garden paths,
the barrenness of the flower beds at that season being relieved by
the sweet-scented winter honeysuckle which defies the seasons
and blooms in December and January as though it were mid-summer.
The Hermitage garden is never without its attractive
features.</p>
<p>In early spring there is first the brilliant bloom of the English
hawthorn, then the narcissi and tulips and hyacinths making the
air heavy with their fragrance, also the jonquils and old-fashioned
blue-bottles and purple shades. Crocuses and butter-and-eggs and,
later, iris and peonies all combine to make the garden a springtime
riot of bloom. So spectacularly do the peonies bloom that
they always attract large crowds of visitors while they are in full
flower, more than a thousand visitors having gone to the Hermitage
garden in one day to witness the rare floral spectacle.</p>
<p>Interspersed with all the conventional plants and shrubs are
some of the native wild flowers that bloom in the fields and along
the river banks near by; for when the Hermitage garden was first
planted the florist&rsquo;s art had not reached its present peak of perfection,
and although the thoughtful General sent home flower
seeds from Philadelphia and Washington, Rachel took pleasure
in augmenting the garden&rsquo;s finery by selections from the surrounding
country. Visitors may still see in the beds there the
nodding Jacob&rsquo;s ladder, the columbine and other such homely
blossoms. The wild yucca, with its semi-tropical appearance, was
brought in from some of the near-by cedar glades, along with
prickly pear cacti and rock roses; and a graceful fringe tree was
planted near the entrance gate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>In the beds in the center of the garden there have always
grown tulips in the springtime and then some kind of annuals to
sustain the succession of blooms through the summer. Early in
June the great collection of ascension lilies begin to bloom, filling
the garden with their perfume; and throughout the summer there
are the roses, both in bush and climbing form, mostly of the old-fashioned
varieties&mdash;moss roses, the yellow briar, maiden&rsquo;s blush,
Louis Phillippe, macrophylla, pink musk, etc.</p>
<p>The shrubbery also contributes its share of blossoms, from the
golden bells, bridal wreath, snowballs and calacanthus of the
spring through the altheas or Rose of Sharon of the summer, to
the pink and red crape myrtles of the late summer which cap off
their showy mass of blooms with a brilliantly colored array of
scarlet leaves in the fall months.</p>
<p>The Hermitage garden offers some form of attraction at any
season of the year.</p>
<p>During the early days of the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association the
wealth of bloom in the garden was turned to good account, especially
in the spring. Then cuttings of jonquils and peonies, literally
by the wagonload, were sent into Nashville and sold on the
street; and there were also sales of seeds and cuttings and surplus
bulbs, so that visitors might take away with them living mementoes
of the Hermitage garden. From this source the association
was able to derive a considerable and much-needed revenue at a
time when funds were scarce and every dollar of income was welcome.</p>
<p>During his lifetime Uncle Alfred, who acted as a guide to
visitors, always took especial interest in the garden and beamed
with proprietary pride when visitors gave expression to their appreciation
of its beauties. &ldquo;Please do not pluck the flowers&rdquo; says a
conspicuous sign by the side of the gate; but if a visitor really
seemed interested in the garden&rsquo;s attractions the old retainer
would slyly say: &ldquo;Now if you like dat rosebud, I won&rsquo;t see you if
you gets it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some idea of what the Hermitage garden looked like in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
old days may be gathered from a description of it which was given
in an interview printed in one of the Nashville papers several
years ago with an old lady who had visited there with her father
when she was a girl. Looking back down the vista of the years,
she said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The flower beds about the middle of the garden were there when the
General lived there. He had an old negro, Alfred, to attend to the garden.
They had a regular vegetable garden combined with the flower garden.
The vegetable garden was not with the flower part of the garden, but
you could see the vegetable garden when you stood in the flower garden
or where the flowers were. They had cabbages, potatoes, beets, beans
and squash and other vegetables in the vegetable part of the garden.
They had sage and thyme around on the edge of the flower beds. They
had in the flower beds hollyhocks, beds of pinks of all colors, rose
bushes, tea roses, macrophylla and cinnamon roses, moss roses, white
lilacs, tiger lilies, heliotrope (white and purple). Some of the beds
were edged with sweet violets. There were poppies in some of the beds,
and hyacinths and tulips. The Washington bower was on the side&mdash;on
the fence and climbing up the trees in the garden&mdash;they were trees with
long white flowers, locust trees I think. The garden was larger then
than it is now&mdash;it was larger east and west than now and was fenced
with a plank fence. There was a weeping willow there but I can&rsquo;t locate
it now. There was a large rope swing near the house and near to the
entrance to the garden. It was tied to the limb of a hickory tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Continuing with her description of the garden this old lady
spoke of two magnolia trees &ldquo;about the middle of the garden near
the tomb&mdash;good big trees&rdquo; and in speaking further of the weeping
willows stated that they were &ldquo;just over the fence, near and
opposite the tomb.&rdquo; She also named more of the flowers that grew
in the old garden: Several big bushes of crape myrtle; verbenas,
all colors; sunflowers; all-colored flags&mdash;red, white and purple;
snowballs; red, pink and white peonies; old-fashioned honeysuckle&mdash;coral,
white and yellow, lilacs, white and purple. The
&ldquo;Washington bower&rdquo; she describes as having a purple flower, so
it was probably the large-flowering variety of clematis which was
also known as the virgin bower. She also mentioned, in enumerating
the shrubbery, &ldquo;japonica bushes&rdquo; which, she said, &ldquo;has red
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
blossoms and comes early and late;&rdquo; and this, we may presume,
was the flowering shrub known now as the English hawthorn and
also called the fire-bush.</p>
<p>The garden as it stands today is just about as it was in the days
when it bloomed and blossomed under Rachel&rsquo;s tender care, except
that the flowering shrubs and bushes have now attained the
size and beauty gained only with the passing of the years. But it
was not in any such condition as this that the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage
Association found it when they took charge. During the wartime
occupation of the premises by the guard of Federal troops the
garden was almost obliterated. Being fenced in and convenient
to the house, it appealed to the cavalrymen as an ideal corral for
their horses, and it was so used during the three years the Federal
troops remained on the grounds. It is easy to imagine the damage
done&mdash;and it is also easy to imagine Old Hickory&rsquo;s devastating
wrath if he had known that his government&rsquo;s troops were so
heedlessly desecrating Rachel&rsquo;s flower garden.</p>
<p>After the war but little was done to repair the damage done by
the soldiers&rsquo; horses. The fence was restored, and this kept out
wandering stock and permitted the hardy shrubs to grow again;
but the paths were overgrown with weeds, washed by the recurring
rains, and in 1889 little trace of the old walkways remained
except for the marginal brick borders. (These bricks, by the way,
were especially designed and made for the purpose, being longer
and thicker than ordinary bricks and also beveled at the top. They
were manufactured on the place when the bricks were burned for
the building of the big house, the depression in the ground where
the clay was dug out for all the bricks being still visible in the
extreme northwestern corner of the big wooded lot directly across
the road from the front entrance to the Hermitage.)</p>
<p>In spite of the discouraging aspect of affairs in the garden when
the ladies took over the property, however, the work of restoring
it to its original beauty was valiantly attacked, and one of their
very first activities was to engage a man to clear away the weeds
and blackberry bushes and the volunteer elms and hickories, rebuild
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
the paths and restore the garden to some semblance of its
former appearance. The work of restoration has been carefully
done, with a full appreciation of the importance of retaining the
spirit and form of the original design and planting. A competent
garden authority was retained to plan the work in later years, and
there has been no effort to modernize or improve the garden&mdash;only
a faithful determination to repair the ravages of time and
present it to the visitor today just as it was when the General and
Rachel were alive and wandered up and down its broad paths in
admiration of its beauty.</p>
<p>The focal point of interest in the garden, of course, is the tomb
in the southeast corner. When his beloved Rachel died in December,
1828, just on the eve of their departure for his first Presidential
inauguration, the old General laid her away in the corner
of the garden and, heavy-hearted, started off for Washington
alone.</p>
<p>During the subsequent eight years, as the bitterly fought battles
of partisan politics raged and surged about him in the nation&rsquo;s
capital, his heart remained buried in the garden at the Hermitage.
In May, 1829, he wrote to the Rev. Hardy M. Cryer (that bizarre
combination of devout Methodist preacher and horseman) saying:
&ldquo;In the day I am laboriously employed, and it is only when
late in the night I retire to my chamber that I have time to think of
or write to my friends. It is then that I feel the great weight of the
late affliction of Providence in the bereavement I have been visited
with in the loss of my dear wife; I find myself a solitary man, deprived
of all hope of happiness this side the grave, and often with
myself at the Hermitage, there to spend the remnant of my days
and daily drop a tear on the tomb of my beloved wife and be prepared,
when Providence wills it, to unite with her in the realm
above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Due to the need for his immediate departure for Washington
after the death of his wife, it was necessary that she be buried in
a plain grave over which a temporary shelter was built. But it was
never the General&rsquo;s idea that her resting-place should go without
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
a more elaborate monument; and even before he left the Hermitage
in January, 1829, he began negotiations looking to the design
and construction of what he described as a &ldquo;monumental tomb.&rdquo;
A contract for the building of the tomb was given a Nashville
contractor, D. Morrison; and Mr. Morrison designed a simple
but impressive structure of classic Greek lines. It is built of stone,
its dome-like top being supported by fluted stone columns and
covered with copper. The structure is surrounded by a simple iron
fence.</p>
<p>The inscription on Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s tomb is popularly supposed
to have been written by the General himself. Mrs. Rachel Jackson
Lawrence stated that it was written by Major Henry Lee, the
talented though scapegrace Virginian who was Jackson&rsquo;s secretary
and a resident of the Hermitage at the time of Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s
death. It has even been attributed to Major John M. Eaton. Whoever
wrote it, it is a beautiful and moving tribute to the pioneer
woman who occupied the central place in Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s
heart throughout his life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Here lie the remains of Mrs. Rachel Jackson, wife of President
Jackson, who died the 22nd of December, 1828, aged sixty-one
years. Her face was fair, her person pleasing, her temper amiable,
her heart kind. She delighted in relieving the wants of her fellow
creatures and cultivated that divine pleasure by the most liberal
and unpretending methods. To the poor she was a benefactor; to
the rich an example; to the wretched a comforter; to the prosperous
an ornament. Her piety went hand in hand with her benevolence,
and she thanked her Creator for being permitted to do
good. A being so gentle and so virtuous slander might wound
but could not dishonor; even death, when he bore her from the
arms of her husband, could but transport her to the bosom of her
God.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In strong contrast to this eloquent eulogy is the Spartan simplicity
of the old General&rsquo;s own epitaph, certainly written by
himself:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p class="center">GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON
<br /><span class="sc">Born March 15, 1767
<br />Died June 8, 1845</span></p>
<p>There would have been no such simplicity as this about Old
Hickory&rsquo;s final resting place, however, if some of his admirers
had had their way. Early in 1845, only a few months before Jackson
died, Commodore J. D. Elliott of the United States Navy,
commander of the old <i>Constitution</i>, brought home from Palestine
the marble sarcophagus in which had rested the remains of
the Roman emperor, Alexander Severus. Commodore Elliott
wrote to General Jackson, advising him that he had brought home
this handsome relic and deposited it with the National Institute
with the suggestion that it be tendered Jackson for his own tomb.
&ldquo;I pray you, General,&rdquo; wrote Elliott, &ldquo;to live on in the fear of the
Lord; dying the death of a Roman soldier, an emperor&rsquo;s coffin
awaits you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But General Jackson, as might have been expected, while courteously
expressing his appreciation of the spirit of veneration that
prompted the proffer, firmly declared that: &ldquo;I can not consent
that my mortal remains shall be laid in a repository prepared for
an emperor or king.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My republican feelings and principles forbid it;&rdquo; Jackson&rsquo;s
letter continues, &ldquo;the simplicity of our system of government forbids
it. Every monument erected to perpetuate the memory of our
heroes and statesmen ought to bear evidence of the economy and
simplicity of our republican institutions and of the plainness of
our republican citizens, who are the sovereigns of our glorious
Union and whose virtue is to perpetuate it. True virtue can not
exist where pomp and parade are the governing passions. It can
only dwell with the people&mdash;the great laboring and producing
classes&mdash;that form the bone and sinew of our confederacy....
I have prepared an humble depository for my mortal body beside
that wherein lies my beloved wife where, without any pomp or
parade, I have requested, when my God calls me to sleep with my
fathers, to be laid; for both of us there to remain until the last
trumpet sounds to call the dead to judgment when we, I hope,
shall rise together clothed with that heavenly body promised to
all who believe in our glorious Redeemer who died for us that
we might live, and by whose atonement I hope for a blessed immortality.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>When the new Hermitage was built in 1819 and the garden
was laid out, one of General Jackson&rsquo;s first acts was to walk out
into the garden with Rachel and select the spot where their remains
would rest side by side when life had passed. At this time
the General&rsquo;s health was precarious, racked as he was by eight
years of almost continuous campaigning while in a debilitated
physical condition, and he frankly expressed the belief that he
would not live long. At that time it seemed highly improbable
that he would outlive the blooming Rachel by nearly seventeen
years.</p>
<p>This burying ground in the corner of the garden is not, legally
speaking, now a part of the Hermitage property. To insure its
permanent care, General Jackson on September 17, 1832, executed
a formal indenture with John H. Eaton, John Coffee, and
Andrew Jackson, junior, &ldquo;and their heirs forever,&rdquo; whereby he
&ldquo;bargained, sold, conveyed and delivered&rdquo; to them in trust &ldquo;one-fourth
part of an acre of ground, out of the Hermitage tract, to
be laid off and run out so as to include the tomb or monument
placed on the remains of his dear departed wife, Rachel Jackson,
and designed as the deposit of the remains of the said Andrew
Jackson when it pleases God to take him hence, and the family
of Andrew Jackson, junior, and his heirs.&rdquo; It is provided that the
trustees and their heirs shall preserve the sacred deposit made
upon said ground and let the tomb or monument remain undisturbed
and &ldquo;hold the ground subject to the use and purpose mentioned,
forever.&rdquo; This conveyance is duly registered in the courthouse
at Nashville, and was taken into consideration when the
Hermitage property was transferred to the state in 1857.</p>
<p>Here in this quiet corner, sheltered by the heavy green foliage of
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
the old magnolias that guard the tomb of the General and Rachel,
are the graves of the adopted son and his family connections.
Here lie Andrew Jackson, junior (the adopted son), and his wife,
Sarah York Jackson; Colonel Andrew Jackson (the adopted son&rsquo;s
son), his wife Amy A. Jackson and his younger brother Captain
Samuel Jackson, who was killed at Chickamauga; also the two
other sons of Andrew Jackson, junior, who died in infancy;
Rachel Jackson Lawrence, daughter of Andrew Jackson, junior,
her husband, Dr. J. M. Lawrence and their son and daughter,
John Marshall Lawrence and Sazie Lawrence Winn; Mrs. Marion
Adams, sister of Sarah York Jackson; and R. E. W. Earle, the
artist.</p>
<p>On the other side of the General&rsquo;s monumental tomb, just across
the graveled walk, is a single mound with a plain, low marble
headstone on which is carved: &ldquo;Uncle Alfred. Died September
4,1901, aged 98 years. Faithful servant of Andrew Jackson.&rdquo; It
was Uncle Alfred&rsquo;s fondest wish in his old days that his mortal
remains might be laid to rest as closely as possible by the side of
his old master, the General; and the promise that he would be so
buried lent solace to his declining years. So long as &ldquo;the Gin&rsquo;ral&rdquo;
lived, Alfred kept as closely by his side as possible; and close by
his side he remains as master and servant sleep their long sleep in
the dark magnolias&rsquo; shade.</p>
<p>When General Jackson in his letters spoke of returning to the
Hermitage to cast a tear on the tomb of his departed wife it was
no mere figure of speech. After his retirement from public life
in 1837 he went back to the home place and spent the rest of his
days on the farm in pleasant association with the family of his
adopted son. Here a part of his daily routine consisted in a long
walk in the afternoon which invariably wound up at the side of
Rachel&rsquo;s tomb, where he was wont to sit in contemplative reflection.
His little granddaughter, Rachel, was his customary companion
on these walks; but she soon learned that when his steps
turned toward the tomb he wished to be alone, and when they
reached the garden gate she always withdrew her hand from his
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
and ran away about her childish diversions, leaving him to his
thoughts. Even after he became bedridden in the last year of his
life, on pleasant days he required that his chair be carried to the
garden and placed by the side of the tomb; and there he sat
through the hours, dreaming of the stormy and pleasant days of
the past.</p>
<p>Just to the east of the tomb the visitor to the garden today sees
a group of hickory trees closely together in a straight row; and
concerning these trees there is an interesting little story. On December
18, 1830, President Jackson received from an admirer in
Ulster, New York, Colonel Charles E. Dudley, a parcel of hickory
nuts (&ldquo;nutts&rdquo; in Jackson&rsquo;s free-and-easy orthography) from a tree
in Ulster said to be the only one of its kind known in New York.
Colonel Dudley doubtless felt that he was the author of a delicate
compliment in sending these unique hickory nuts to Old
Hickory himself; and the President in his formal note of thanks,
seemed duly appreciative of the honor intended. &ldquo;To perpetuate
this memento of the kind regard of Mr. and Mrs. Dudley,&rdquo; he
wrote in the formal official third person of the period, &ldquo;he has
sent one dozen of these nutts to be planted in his garden at the
Hermitage, to encircle the tomb of his departed wife, and to have
the following inscription engraved on the marble. &lsquo;The Dudley
hickory of Ulster, New York, presented by Mr. and Mrs. Dudley
to the President.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further reference to the nuts is seen in a letter written by
President Jackson in the spring of 1831 to his adopted son, who
was about to return to Tennessee: &ldquo;I sent to Mr. Daniel Donelson
some hickory nutts with a request that he would hand them to
the overseer with a letter directing Steele to plant them around
your mother&rsquo;s tomb.&rdquo; That they were duly planted is attested by
the attention-attracting row of tall, straight trees seen there today;
but there is no sign of the inscription mentioned in General Jackson&rsquo;s
letter to Colonel Dudley. No one now living remembers
whether the trees were planted in strict accordance with the General&rsquo;s
expressed wish that they encircle the tomb, although one of

Jackson&rsquo;s biographers does mention that &ldquo;some fine hickory trees
that grew in the garden&rdquo; were at one time removed in a mistaken
effort to improve the appearance of the place.</p>
<p>Despite the careful and painstaking preparations made by General
Jackson to insure that the last resting place of his mortal remains
would be by the side of his beloved wife in the tomb in
the Hermitage garden, it was only by the interposition of the
governor of the state that there was frustrated an effort to nullify
this last wish of the old General.</p>
<p>When the state purchased the property in 1856 and then began
to make plans to tender it to the Federal government as a suitable
site for a military academy in the South, somebody had the bright
idea of digging up the bodies of the General and Mrs. Jackson
and removing them from the Hermitage to Capitol Hill in Nashville.
Accordingly a bill was introduced in the General Assembly
in 1860 providing for such removal, and it was promptly passed
by the Senate. Before the lower house could act on it, however,
Andrew Jackson, junior, heard of the plan and immediately raised
a loud and well-justified protest. Directly to Governor Harris he
went to remonstrate against the enactment of the bill, pointing
out that upon his death-bed General Jackson had expressed the
hope that the remains of himself and his wife should under no
circumstances be removed from the Hermitage. Governor Harris
thereupon sent a special message to the Senate and House of
Representatives &ldquo;respectfully recommending&rdquo; that the bill be rejected
and that Old Hickory&rsquo;s wishes be respected. In those days
a respectful recommendation from Governor Harris was just
about equivalent to an edict, and nothing more was heard about
disturbing the Jackson remains.</p>
<p>But, although this plan for the official removal of the remains
was defeated, there was another mysterious and criminal attempt
on General Jackson&rsquo;s body several years later. It was late in the
summer of 1894 that a visitor appeared at the Hermitage one
morning and, as was the customary procedure with visitors, was
courteously conducted through the house and about the grounds.
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
It was noted at the time that he displayed an unusual interest in
the Jackson family and home life and talked with Uncle Alfred
at great length about his old master. He showed particular interest
in the tomb; although, at the time, no sinister intent was
attached to his interest. After spending the morning on the place
he went to a near-by country store for a bite to eat during the middle
of the day and then returned and loitered about the premises
throughout the afternoon until nearly dark. At length, to the
relief of the custodian who was growing vaguely apprehensive,
the stranger departed; and it was thought he had gone for good.</p>
<p>It is easy to imagine the custodian&rsquo;s horrified astonishment, on
visiting the garden next morning, to find a large and gaping hole
in the ground on the west side of the tomb near the head of
General Jackson&rsquo;s grave. The hole was deep enough to expose
the stone foundations of the tomb; but fortunately the burial
vaults were enclosed in a solid wall of masonry, and the grave-robber&rsquo;s
felonious intentions were defeated. It developed, upon
inquiry, that the mysterious stranger had borrowed a spade from
the near-by Donelson home at Tulip Grove the preceding afternoon
and that it had been carefully returned and left at the door
of the house in the early morning hours. The ghoul had evidently,
from the extent of his operations, worked all night in opening
the big excavation; and he was doubtless exasperated to discover
that the careful and substantial work of the builder of the tomb
in 1831 had made the General&rsquo;s last home impregnable to such
assaults.</p>
<p>The Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association made every effort to ferret
out the mystery; but, with the limited means at their disposal,
they were able to learn nothing at the time. But several months
later a man died in a hospital in New York who confessed that
he was a professional body-snatcher (a practice not uncommon
at that time) and that among other exploits of his infamous career
he had made the ineffectual attempt on the Jackson tomb. Just
what he intended to do with the body if his efforts had been successful
was not revealed; and today it is hard to imagine how the
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
body of an ex-President would command any premium even in
the grave-robbers&rsquo; underworld; but the fact remains that the attempt
was made, and it was only because of the staunch construction
of the tomb that the body of the General remained undisturbed.</p>
<h3><span class="sc">The Grounds</span></h3>
<p>The most attractive feature of the Hermitage grounds, aside
from the mansion house itself and the garden, is the guitar-shaped
driveway leading up to the front door from the entrance gate.
All along both sides of the drive the General planted cedar seedlings,
brought in from the near-by glades, and most of these original
cedars, now grown into stately trees, still remain. The few
that have succumbed to the stress of the years and the storms have
been replaced with younger brothers, thus preserving the General&rsquo;s
original plan. The wood of the old trees uprooted by storms
has been carefully preserved and is used for the manufacture of
souvenirs and novelties which are sold to visitors.</p>
<p>Until very recently the front drive was still used as the visitors&rsquo;
approach to the house; but it was feared that the continued every-day
use of the drive might shorten the life of the old cedar trees,
and so entrance and exit are now afforded by a modernly built
driveway on the western edge of the front lawn. This drive is
lined with young hardwood trees of historical significance, they
having been transplanted from the historic battlefields of New
Orleans and Alabama where Jackson made himself a world figure.
There are thrifty young oaks here from Chalmette Plain, and from
The Horseshoe, Fort Jackson, and Talladega&mdash;names indelibly associated
in history with General Jackson&rsquo;s ever-victorious combats
with the British and with the Creek Indians. This step in the
beautification of the grounds was made possible through the
liberality of Mrs. B. F. Wilson of Nashville, when she was regent
of the association.</p>
<p>Just to the rear of the dining-room wing of the house is the semi-detached
brick kitchen, with its big open fireplace, where all the
family&rsquo;s meals were prepared during the years of the old house&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
occupancy. The kitchen separate from the house served to eliminate
the noise and heat and odors of cooking, so far as the family
and guests were concerned. It multiplied the task of serving the
meals, but of what importance was that when labor was so plentiful?
In the kitchen may be seen the cooking appliances used in
the early days when there were fowls and huge roasts on the spits
in front of the fire, potatoes boiling in the big pot on the crane,
and doubtless hoecakes on the griddle and hot biscuits in the
oven. Aunt Betty was the cook during the early days and up until
the time she died in 1852; and in those days the cook ruled the
kitchen with an iron hand. There were swarms of little black girls
to keep the fire going and turn the spits and sweep the ashes and
bring water from the springhouse and carry dishes to the dining
room&mdash;and Aunt Betty was their boss. Housewives of today, accustomed
to the culinary conveniences afforded by electric ranges
and other modern trappings, wonder how Aunt Betty, cooking on
an open fireplace, could prepare the food for a big family and a
house generally full of guests. But those were the days of simple
fare, simply prepared; and Aunt Betty was a master of that art.</p>
<p>Behind the kitchen is the big brick smokehouse&mdash;empty now,
but a century ago filled with the great supply of hams and bacon
needed for the feeding of a large household and a hundred slaves&mdash;not
to mention the numerous guests. A normal supply of meat
when hogs were killed and the hams and sides salted down and
smoked was from 20,000 to 25,000 pounds. Today only its dark,
smoke-stained rafters remain to tell of all the succulent country
hams that once hung there, but there still clings about it an elusive
and entrancing aroma reminiscent of the days when it was stocked
with the plantation&rsquo;s supply of meat. At hog-killing time&mdash;the
first freezing weather in the early winter&mdash;a big fireplace in the
cellar of the big house was used to heat water to scald the hogs
and also for rendering the lard in the big black iron kettles.</p>
<p>The carriage house, to the rear of the smokehouse, is not the
original building used for this purpose. It was put there during
comparatively recent years for the purpose of conveniently displaying
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
the old Jackson family carriage. This old family carriage
looks rusty and faded now, but a century ago it was the vehicular
equivalent of the finest eight-cylindered limousine available today.
Nothing but the best was good enough for General Jackson,
whether he was buying a broadcloth suit or a horse or a carriage.
Even before he was President he had an eye for style and a modest
display of pomp. Old residents of Nashville used to tell of how
the General would drive into town &ldquo;in a carriage drawn by four
handsome iron-gray horses, attended by servants in blue livery
with brass buttons, glazed hats and silver bands.&rdquo; These carriage
horses were the apple of the old man&rsquo;s eye, and whenever he referred
to &ldquo;my grays&rdquo; it was with a note of real pride.</p>
<p>In the carriage house is also to be seen the framework, all that
now remains of the handsome phaeton presented to General Jackson
by the admiring citizens of New York. Unfortunately this
vehicle was burned while Colonel Andrew Jackson, III, was living
in Cincinnati, before he had sold all the family relics to the association.
The wooden parts of this phaeton were made from timbers
taken from the historic old ship <i>Constitution</i>, and it was very
highly cherished by the General. It was in this phaeton that he
and Martin Van Buren rode to the Capitol together for the inauguration
March 4, 1837; and when he left Washington for
Nashville he took the most elaborate pains to see that it was properly
crated and shipped to him at home. It was carried across the
river to Alexandria and thence by boat to Philadelphia. There
it was shipped on a coastwise vessel to New Orleans, and thence
by river boats to the Hermitage.</p>
<p>A good description of this historic vehicle is embraced in the
account of the Van Buren inauguration written for the <i>New York
Mirror</i> by Nathaniel P. Willis. Mr. Willis, who speaks of it as
&ldquo;the elegant phaeton made of the wood of the old frigate <i>Constitution</i>,&rdquo;
describes it in these words: &ldquo;it has a seat for two, with
a driver&rsquo;s box, covered with a superb hammercloth, and set up
rather high in front; the wheels and body are low, and there are
bars for baggage behind; altogether, for lightness and elegance,
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
it would be a creditable turn-out for Long Acre. The material is
excessively beautiful&mdash;a fine-grained oak, polished to a very high
degree, with its colours delicately brought out by a coat of varnish.
The wheels are very slender and light, but strong; and, with
all its finish, it looks a vehicle capable of a great deal of service. A
portrait of the <i>Constitution</i>, under full sail, is painted on the pannels.&rdquo;
In this article Mr. Willis refers to another vehicle presented
to the retiring President by &ldquo;an eccentrick mechanick&rdquo;&mdash;a sulky
made entirely of rough-cut hickory with the bark on, with some
curiously twisted and gnarled branches ingeniously turned into
handles and whip-box. It must have been a vehicular monstrosity.
At any rate, Old Hickory avoided bringing such an outlandish
rig back to the Hermitage by generously presenting it to his successor,
Mr. Van Buren.</p>
<p>Behind the present carriage house is the brick house in which
the caretaker lives, this also being of modern construction. The
stable standing back of the caretaker&rsquo;s house was built a few
years ago when the log and frame stable burned. This building
had replaced the original old brick stable which was built in
1832 and which stood much nearer to the house, about where the
carriage house is now located. The old driveway leading back to
the stable may still be seen in the lawn to the west of the mansion
house. The brick house where souvenirs are now sold is a replica
of the original carriage house, being built on its old foundations.</p>
<p>Just to the right of the back door of the house is a deep, rock-lined
well, with an old-fashioned cedar windlass and oak bucket.
In the early days, however, the water supply was obtained from
a never-failing spring which is reached by the long brick walk
now leading from the Hermitage&rsquo;s back door. This gushing
spring helped fix the location of the original log Hermitage near
by, as a convenient water supply was a primary essential in the
pioneer days. One of Jackson&rsquo;s first acts, after building the log
house to live in when he moved from Hunter&rsquo;s Hill, was to enclose
the spring in a stone springhouse which Mrs. Jackson could
use for keeping her milk and butter cold. Mrs. Jackson, who took
<span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
a lively interest in the farm affairs, was especially proud of this
spring which was and is an exceptionally good one.</p>
<p>The brick walk down to the springhouse is now shaded by a
grove of trees; but originally this was the &ldquo;colt lot,&rdquo; the trees
having been planted after the house was reclaimed. On the way
down to the spring there may be seen close on the other side of
the fence to the left the sole remaining relic of Hunter&rsquo;s Hill&mdash;a
log cabin which stood there after the old house was burned,
and which was in recent years taken down and removed to this
location on the Hermitage property where it might be preserved.</p>
<p>There are no slave quarters to be seen at the Hermitage, for in
Jackson&rsquo;s day the slaves who worked in the fields were scattered
in their cabins about the plantation and did not all live in one
long row of houses as was the prevailing custom in the South
generally. There remains, however, a two-roomed log cabin just
to the north of the garden which was the home of Uncle Alfred
to the day of his death.</p>
<p>Uncle Alfred was born on the Hermitage plantation just about
the time Jackson moved there from Hunter&rsquo;s Hill and lived there
all of his days. Living a long lifetime of almost a complete century,
the span of his existence covered the years of Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s
whole life after his rise to distinction. He saw the building
of the Hermitage, he saw it burned and rebuilt, he witnessed its
decline and its rescue and its development into a magnet for visitors
from all over the country. As a shiny-eyed boy of twelve he
stood with the other slaves, young and old, at the big gate that
never-to-be-forgotten day in 1815 when the General returned
triumphant from his great victory at New Orleans; and thirty
years later it was his strong arms that helped support the emaciated
body of the old statesman as he sat up in his bed and gasped
out his dying breath.</p>
<p>Born and living sixty years a slave, he was too old to change
his ways when the state of Tennessee enacted the emancipation
amendment to its Constitution in January, 1865. Freedom meant
nothing to him then; he just went on living with the Jacksons
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
until he could get his bearings&mdash;and then, in a few weeks, his
master died and he stayed on with his old mistress because he
felt that she needed him. When the state turned the property over
to the Ladies&rsquo; Hermitage Association and the next generation of
Jacksons moved out, he still went on living there in his same old
cabin. Nobody ever seemed to consider the possibility of his moving
away. Through the years he seemed to have become an integral
part of the property, just as much a fixture as the stout log
cabin in which he lived.</p>
<p>Alfred&rsquo;s mother was Betty the cook; and in his youth his duties
were those of a hostler and attendant at the stables. In the caste
system of slavery he was undeniably of a higher stratum than the
field hands; but the house servants, the real elite, always referred
to him contemptuously as being from &ldquo;across the yard&rdquo;&mdash;their
aloof designation of the stable area. At times Alfred rode the
General&rsquo;s horses in some of their important races, drove teams on
the farm when needed for that duty, and occasionally served as
driver of the family carriage. In all these duties he was noted
for the way he had with horses and for his careful manner of
handling them. When little Andrew, the adopted son, grew too
old to be tied to the apron strings of his black mammy-nurse,
Aunt Hannah, he was turned over to the tender care of Alfred&mdash;six
years his senior&mdash;who served him faithfully in the complex
r&ocirc;le of nurse, companion, bodyguard, mentor, valet, and chum&mdash;that
indescribable relationship known now only as a memory
lingering in the recollections of those old men whose youthful
days were spent in the loving care and companionship of slaves
who were not merely servants but guardians and tutors&mdash;and
friends.</p>
<p>When Andrew reached young manhood and was old enough
to travel about the country, Alfred sometimes was called upon
to go with him as his body servant; and the members of the family
for years enjoyed telling of how Alfred saw to it that the young
master had the best of the available accommodations whenever
they went together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>On the occasion of Alfred&rsquo;s first service in the unfamiliar r&ocirc;le
of valet, young Andrew was setting out on a steamboat trip to
New Orleans. His body servant was taken sick just on the eve of
their departure, so Alfred was called in from the fields to take
his place&mdash;not, however, without some misgiving on the master&rsquo;s
part. Alfred was given some superficial coaching in his new duties
and off they started. The next morning young Jackson was aroused
from his slumbers by the noise of a disturbance on deck, and
emerged from his stateroom to find Alfred in bellicose possession
of the washbasin, soap, and towels, defying the early-rising
passengers who desired to make use of the steamboat&rsquo;s primitive
toilet facilities. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t nobody wash hisself till Massa Andrew&rsquo;s
used these things,&rdquo; he was declaring stoutly. &ldquo;Reckon I knows my
business better&rsquo;n dat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Andrew, junior, married in 1831 and brought his
bride to the White House, President Jackson presented to his
new daughter-in-law a young slave woman named Gracey to act
as her personal maid. When the young couple came on to the
Hermitage in the spring of 1832 Gracey came with them, and the
young maid from Virginia soon attracted Alfred&rsquo;s favorable attention.
The master and mistress looked with favor on the match,
and so they were married in the fall of 1837. Mrs. Jackson made
a gala affair of the wedding, having the ceremony performed in
the large central hall of the Hermitage and giving the couple a
handsome wedding supper.</p>
<p>The story of the fidelity of Alfred and Gracey to their white
folk is the familiar idyl of the Old South&mdash;the faithful slaves&rsquo;
devotion to their former masters in the time of the latter&rsquo;s adversities.
Gracey and Alfred had been with the Jacksons when they
were in the White House, the first family of the land, they had
enjoyed the flush days of the old General&rsquo;s successes and popularity.
And when the evil days came&mdash;when Alfred&rsquo;s young master,
now no longer young, cast off the burden of life and was laid
to rest in the corner of the garden, and Gracey&rsquo;s mistress faced
life lonely and impoverished, with no farm left to work and no
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
slaves left to work it&mdash;then Alfred and Gracey did not go off to
set up homes of their own, in their new-found freedom, as did all
of the other Hermitage black folks, but stayed there in their cabin
to serve the mistress they loved as long as she lived.</p>
<p>Gracey died in 1887, shortly before the death of Mrs. Sarah
York Jackson; but Alfred lived until 1901, and played no small
part in making the Hermitage a place of interest to visitors. As
long as he was physically able he served as a guide, and those
who came from afar to visit the Jackson shrine deemed it a rare
privilege&mdash;as indeed it was&mdash;to be shown through the house and
garden by one who had been there when the spark of his old
master&rsquo;s vibrant personality made the Hermitage a place alive
with his presence.</p>
<p>Alfred was fully conscious of the fact that he was a living connecting
link between the departed great man and his living admirers,
and he never tired of telling visitors stories illustrative of
the greatness of the old General. To Uncle Alfred there was no
flaw or blemish in his old master&rsquo;s character or fame. His idolatrous
veneration was well illustrated by his often quoted reply to
a visitor who asked him if he thought General Jackson went to
Heaven. &ldquo;Co&rsquo;se he went to Heaven,&rdquo; Uncle Alfred answered with
vigor, &ldquo;if he want to. If he want to go dere, who gwine stop
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he grew too feeble to act as a guide he kept to his cabin,
and though the ills of his accumulating years bore heavily on him
he always enjoyed chatting with visitors who stopped to talk with
him as he sat on his doorstep in the summer or by the blazing logs
in his big fireplace in the winter. Although never bedridden,
his strength slowly faded away and at last he died quietly on September
4, 1901.</p>
<p>Not only was he given the boon of being buried in the garden,
near the tomb of his deeply venerated old master, but the added
honor was given him of having his funeral held in the hall of the
Hermitage, his casket resting on the same spot where he and
Gracey had stood to be married more than sixty years before. His
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
funeral was attended by large numbers of his friends, both black
and white, and ministers of both races participated in the burial
services. Both Alfred and Gracey had originally been members
of the little Hermitage church, but after Gracey&rsquo;s death, Alfred
transferred his membership to a near-by church of his own people.</p>
<p>In typically weird cadences Uncle Alfred&rsquo;s black-skinned friends
raised their quavering voices to sing his old favorite:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">On Jordan&rsquo;s stormy banks I stand and cast a wistful eye;</p>
<p class="t0">On Canaan&rsquo;s bright and happy shore where my possessions lie.</p>
</div>
<p>And so he was borne through the broad front door of the Hermitage
and laid to rest in his long home in the garden. &ldquo;Faithful
servant of Andrew Jackson&rdquo; it says on his modest tombstone; and
all those who read the Scripture know of the reward in Heaven
promised to the good and faithful servant.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<h2 id="c6">VI: THE HERMITAGE HOUSEHOLD</h2>
<p>The true character of a man in public life is often misjudged
by the people when only his public acts are taken
into consideration; but the facts about his real disposition
and inclinations are invariably revealed clearly and infallibly in
his home life. Andrew Jackson stands this test admirably; for
visitors to the Hermitage were always impressed with the gentle
and considerate conduct of the man at home. A contemporary
wrote that the Jackson household &ldquo;was the abode of native dignity,
artless good cheer, instinctive courtesy and a hospitality
which no adjective is adequate to describe.&rdquo; And, making due
allowance for the permissible hyperbole of a grateful guest, it is
a compliment to any family to receive such a warm tribute.</p>
<p>Parton records that Jackson, &ldquo;so irascible sometimes and sometimes
so savage, was never so much as impatient with children,
wife or servants. It used to astonish people who came for the first
time to the Hermitage to find that its master, of whose fierce ways
and words they had heard so much, was indeed the gentlest and
tenderest of men.&rdquo; And then he proceeds to tell of how an unexpected
visitor to the Hermitage one evening found the old man
seated in his big rocking chair &ldquo;with a chubby boy wedged in on
each side of him and a third, perhaps, in his lap&rdquo; while he was
trying to read his newspaper.</p>
<p>A similarly flattering picture of the domestic side of the General&rsquo;s
life is to be found in the published recollections of Thomas
H. Benton. Benton knew all sides of Jackson&rsquo;s character for he
was first his admiring young henchman, then his bitter enemy
and then his devoted friend again. He was with Jackson on the
battlefield, he was with him in the political maelstrom of Washington,
he visited him frequently in the quiet seclusion of the
Hermitage; and of the latter aspect of the old chieftan&rsquo;s life, Benton
says that &ldquo;He was gentle in his house and alive to the tenderest
emotions.&rdquo; As an instance of this&mdash;an instance, it should
be observed, greatly at variance with the popular conception of
his character but worth more than a long discourse in showing
what that character really was, Colonel Benton tells of how he
<span class="pb" id="Page_98">98</span>
arrived at the Hermitage one wet, chilly evening in February and
came upon the General in the twilight sitting alone before the
fire, a lamb and a child between his knees. &ldquo;He started a little,&rdquo;
says Benton, &ldquo;called a servant to remove the two innocents to another
room, and explained to me how it was. The child had cried
because his lamb was out in the cold and begged him to bring it
in&mdash;which he had done to please the child, his adopted son, then
not two years old. The ferocious man does not do that!&rdquo; This
incident made a deep impression on Colonel Benton, and he referred
to it again in a eulogy on Jackson&rsquo;s character delivered
after the latter&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Another early visitor at the Hermitage left this observation concerning
Jackson, the host: &ldquo;Had we not seen General Jackson before
we would have taken him for a visitor, not the host of the
mansion. He greeted us cordially and bade us feel at home, but
gave us distinctly to understand that he took no trouble to look
after any but his lady guests. As for the gentlemen, there were
the parlor, the dining-room, the library, the sideboard and its refreshments,
there were the servants; and if anything was wanting
all that was necessary was to ring. He was as good as his word.
He did not sit at the head of the table, but mingled with his
guests, and always preferred a seat between two ladies, obviously
seeking a chair between different ones at various times. He was
very easy and graceful in his attentions; free and often playful,
but always dignified and earnest, in his conversation. He was quick
to perceive every point of word or manner, was gracious in approval,
but did not hesitate to dissent with courtesy when he differed.
He obviously had a hidden vein of humor, loved aphorism,
and could politely convey a sense of polite travesty. If put upon
his metal he was very positive but gravely respectful. He conversed
freely and seemed to be absorbed in attention to what
the ladies were saying; but if a word of note was uttered at any
distance from him audibly he caught it by a quick and pertinent
comment without losing or leaving the subject about which he
was talking to another person&mdash;such was his ease of sociability
without levity or lightness of activity, and without being oracular
or heavy in his remarks.&rdquo; And isn&rsquo;t that a perfect picture of the
gentlemanly host?</p>
<div class="img" id="fig30">

<p class="pcap">A corner of General Jackson&rsquo;s bedroom. His favorite portrait of Mrs. Jackson

<p class="pcap">The broad entrance hall, showing the famous scenic wall paper and the graceful spiral stairway.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>As a specific and characteristic instance of Jackson&rsquo;s attentiveness
and courtliness to his guests one of the neighbors used to tell
of how a homely young girl who had been taken by Mrs. Jackson
to be raised at the Hermitage was acting the part of a wall-flower
at an evening&rsquo;s entertainment there one time. &ldquo;When all
the beautiful women and distinguished men had been introduced
around,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;General Jackson, seeing that she had been
forgotten, caught her by the arm and introduced her with so much
earnestness as to indelibly impress a pleasurable sensation with
her until her death and was ever a green spot in her life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is significant of the beneficent influence of Rachel Jackson
on the Hermitage and its social life that no guest ever recorded
his impressions of a visit there without pleasant mention of her
gracious presence. Indeed, no account of the home life of the Hermitage
could be complete without a deferential tribute to the
spirit of this woman who occupied so large a place in Jackson&rsquo;s
life and whose lovable nature contributed so much to making the
Hermitage a delightful place to be. &ldquo;Her quiet, cheerful and admirable
management of her household&rdquo; made a lasting impression
on Colonel Benton, and of her he says in his recollections:
&ldquo;She had the General&rsquo;s own warm heart, frank manner and
hospitable temper; and no two persons could have been better
suited to each other, lived more happily together, or made a
house more attractive to visitors. She had the faculty&mdash;a rare one&mdash;of
retaining names and titles in a throng of visitors, addressing
each one appropriately, and dispensing hospitality to all with a
cordiality which enhanced its value. No bashful youth or plain
old man whose modesty sat them down at the lower end of the
table could escape her cordial attention any more than the titled
gentlemen on her right and left. Young persons were her delight,
and she always had her house filled with them&mdash;clever young
women and clever young men&mdash;all calling her affectionately
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
&lsquo;Aunt Rachel.&rsquo; I was young then and was one of that number. I
owe it to early recollections and to cherished convictions to bear
this faithful testimony to the memory of its long mistress, the
loved and honored wife of a great man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Rachel, according to another contemporary, was &ldquo;the
childless mother of all the young people of the neighborhood;&rdquo;
and the old house probably didn&rsquo;t seem much like a hermitage
with the young folks making the rafters ring with their laughing
and singing, the General gaily joining in the chorus when his old
favorite tunes were raised.</p>
<p>The fine ladies of New Orleans, when Rachel went there in
1815 to join in the celebration of the general&rsquo;s great victory, tittered
at her homely appearance and her sun-tanned arms and face;
latter-day biographers and magazine writers have written of her
with slightly up-tilted noses, overemphasizing her alleged lack
of formal education and dwelling unduly on her old-fashioned
habit of smoking a pipe by her fireside at night&mdash;a practice suggested
by her family doctor as a relief from asthma. But if ever a
woman had a heart of gold it was Rachel Jackson; and none ever
visited the Hermitage while she was alive but went away to sing
her praises.</p>
<p>Contrary to the popular impression, perhaps, the Hermitage
household was conducted on the lines of an old-fashioned Christian
home, with a regular devotional hour in the evening which
was attended by the whole family and also by the house servants.
This practice was followed after Rachel&rsquo;s death as well as before.
After the son&rsquo;s marriage his wife always conducted the musical
part of the devotional exercises; but when she was not at home the
old General himself would line the hymn (&ldquo;Alas, and Did My
Saviour Bleed&rdquo; was one of his favorites) and lead in prayer.</p>
<p>Young Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s widowed sister, Mrs. Adams, was musically
talented, and during the General&rsquo;s declining years she gave
him much pleasure with her playing of the piano and guitar and
with her singing. The General&rsquo;s favorite song was &ldquo;Auld Lang
Syne;&rdquo; but when Mrs. Adams would take her guitar of an evening,
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
seated at the fireside, and would play and sing &ldquo;Johnny Sands&rdquo; or
some of the other humorous songs of the day, Jackson showed
his keen enjoyment even though he loved the old songs best.</p>
<p>Mrs. Adams, with her musical talent, was a valued and enlivening
addition to the Hermitage family group, and after her
coming she always provided the music for the many impromptu
dances in the Hermitage parlors. Despite his advanced years the
General took great delight in these affairs; and it was the customary
thing for him to start off the festivities of the Virginia Reel
by taking his daughter-in-law as a partner and dancing the first
round with her.</p>
<p>It was one of the minor tragedies of Jackson&rsquo;s life that he, who
set such store by his home life, should have no family of his own;
but to fill the vacant place in his heart left by the lack of children
he legally adopted his wife&rsquo;s nephew and bestowed on him the
most sincere and lavish affection a father could give his own son.</p>
<p>It was on December 22, 1809, that the wife of Severn Donelson,
Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s brother, gave birth to twin boys. The news reached
the General and his wife as they sat at the breakfast table in the
old Hermitage. Mrs. Jackson, upon receiving the message, looked
across the table at the General and said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid brother&rsquo;s wife
will be unable to raise both the little fellows with all those other
children&mdash;she isn&rsquo;t very strong, you know. Suppose we take one
of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel&rsquo;s merest suggestion was law to the General; and so
after breakfast the horses were brought to the door and away they
went to brother Severn&rsquo;s to see the new twins and suggest the
adoption. The mother agreed to the proposal, the General promptly
had the infant&rsquo;s name officially changed to Andrew Jackson,
junior; and from that day he treated him as his own son. Aunt
Hannah, the most trusted of the house servants, was assigned to
his special care; and it was in her strong arms that he was carried
two miles through the woods from his birthplace to the Hermitage
which was to be his future home. Hannah lived to be 101 years
old, and never tired of telling of how she reared the young master.
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
Later she was assigned to the duty of looking after Mrs. Jackson;
and then Alfred took charge of little Andrew and helped bring
him up to the estate of young manhood. Those were gay days on
the Hermitage farm when little Andrew was growing up, and
the loyal and loving Alfred was taking him hunting and fishing,
along with the little Donelson cousins.</p>
<p>The tender and patient devotion of the old General to his
adopted son is one of the most touching chapters of his life. From
the day old Hannah brought him in her arms across the threshold
of the Hermitage, the General ever referred to him as &ldquo;my son;&rdquo;
and had the boy actually been his own offspring he could not have
treated him with more kindly and enduring affection. In his
letters to his wife, while he was off fighting the Indians in Alabama,
he never failed to mention little Andrew; and in one of
these letters, following the bloody battle with the Creeks at Tallapoosa,
he wrote: &ldquo;Tell Andrew that I have for him a warrior&rsquo;s
bow and arrow.&rdquo; The picture of the rough, turbulent, Indian-fighting
frontiersman painted by conventional history does not
tell us much of this side of the old soldier&rsquo;s nature.</p>
<p>When the General returned from the Indian wars, Mrs. Jackson
went to Huntsville to meet him and carried the little boy
along; and when she went to New Orleans in 1815 to attend the
popular celebration given there by the citizens in honor of her
illustrious husband&rsquo;s great victory over the British, little Andrew
again went with her. A current account of visit of the General&rsquo;s
family to New Orleans brings out the fact that little Andrew was
a pet at headquarters; and it is easy to believe the statement that
the General could not deny him anything and spent every leisure
moment in playing with him, often holding him in his arms while
he transacted business. One evening, so the story goes, some companies
of soldiers stopped beneath the windows of headquarters
and the crowd began to cheer the General and call for his appearance.
Little Andrew, asleep in the next room, was waked up
by the commotion and began to cry. The General had already
started to the window to answer the cheers of the people in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
street below, but when he heard the boy whimpering he went to
his bedside, picked him up, soothed away his tears and carried
him along to the balcony where he bowed to the people and, at
the same time, amused little Andrew with the scene in the street.</p>
<p>When the General was made Governor of the Florida Territory
in 1821, and went there with Mrs. Jackson to take up his residence,
they took Andrew with them as Mrs. Jackson would not
think of leaving him behind; but the country around Pensacola
was not, with its heat and its mosquitoes, an ideal place for a child,
and so in August he was sent home when one of Jackson&rsquo;s staff
officers returned to Tennessee.</p>
<p>As the boy grew older he was sent to college in Nashville and
was given every opportunity available to the son of a prosperous
and distinguished father; and it is easy to see, from what Jackson
said and wrote, that he had the greatest ambitions for the boy he
had chosen to be his son and to perpetuate his name.</p>
<p>When he went to Washington to be inaugurated President in
1828 he left young Andrew at the Hermitage to help wind up affairs
there; but Andrew went on to Washington in a few months,
as soon as his foster father had got settled in the White House.
After a brief stay in Washington he returned to the Hermitage,
however, chiefly because of a love affair with a young lady of
the neighborhood, a ward of their neighbor Colonel Ward who
lived at Hunter&rsquo;s Hill and mentioned in one of Jackson&rsquo;s letters
as &ldquo;the daughter of my deceased friend,&rdquo; but now known only as
&ldquo;Miss Flora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s solicitude for his son&rsquo;s happiness and well-being was
never more strongly revealed than in the benevolent letters of
fatherly advice he wrote him from Washington during the late
summer of 1829 when the young man was back at the Hermitage
prosecuting his suit. It is a little amusing to find the President
setting aside the affairs of state to dip his oar into the management
of the courtship; but Jackson had a flair for match-making,
and also his affection for Andrew was so great that he did not
want to see him make any mistake. While the love affair was progressing
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
he made no direct objection to it, although he repeatedly
expressed the firm conviction that Andrew should not permit the
young lady to trifle with him but should press her for a positive
answer one way or the other; and he was obviously relieved when
his son wrote him at last to say that he had been rejected. The
General wrote Andrew a kindly letter of consolation, venturing
the sour-grapes comment that Miss Flora was &ldquo;a fine girl, but a
coquette;&rdquo; and he begged the young man not to enter into any
more love affairs without consulting him.</p>
<p>Young Andrew returned to the White House after the shattering
of his Tennessee romance; but it wasn&rsquo;t long before he again
fell a victim. This time the object of his affections was Miss
Sarah York of Philadelphia, one of three orphan sisters of good
family and social standing. Miss Sarah was a spirited young lady
and had declared her unwillingness to marry the ordinary run of
suitors. Indeed, she was quoted as saying that she &ldquo;wouldn&rsquo;t
marry less than a prince.&rdquo; But the sons of kings were hard to find
in this republican country, and so she evidently decided to lower
her sights sufficiently to be satisfied with a mere President&rsquo;s son.
Jackson approved of the match when told of his son&rsquo;s new flame,
and the wedding took place in Philadelphia on November 24,
1831. Acting on the old General&rsquo;s instructions, Andrew brought
his bride to the White House at once; and, from the moment
he clasped his new daughter in his arms at the front door of the
White House, she had a place in his affections until the time of
his death that was never disputed by anyone.</p>
<p>Andrew and his young wife remained with Jackson in Washington
until the spring of 1832, setting out on April 12th to take
up their residence in the Hermitage, which was to be their home
all the remaining years of their lives. Accompanying them on the
journey to Tennessee was Sarah&rsquo;s cousin, Miss Emma Forbes, who
came along to keep Sarah company while she was getting accustomed
to her new home, and the General strictly enjoined Andrew
to &ldquo;give all your attention to Sarah and Emma. They are strangers
in a strange land.&rdquo; Evidently Andrew made the strangers feel
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
very much at home, so much so that Miss Emma soon fell in love
and married Andrew&rsquo;s own twin brother, Thomas Jefferson
Donelson, and became a resident of the Hermitage community.</p>
<p>Young Andrew was at this time twenty-three years old; and
although the General expressed the fullest confidence in him and
made it clear to him that he wanted him to take charge of affairs
at the Hermitage and run the place, he nevertheless took the precaution
to write out for him before he left a memorandum which
is a model of thoughtful and thorough suggestions for a young
man about to assume the management of an extensive estate. In
this memorandum he authorized the son to purchase from Samuel
Donelson a tract of 100 acres adjoining the Hermitage for $1,500;
instructed him to have a settlement with the contractor, Mr.
Morrison, who had been making the additions to the Hermitage
and building the tomb in the garden; instructed him to arrive at
a settlement of the accounts of Steele, the overseer, giving him a
detailed account of all the involved transactions in which that
worthy had tangled himself; reminded him that he was expecting
Steele to make enough brick to build a new stable for the riding
and carriage horses, with suggestions as to the plan for the stable;
gave careful instructions about the desired procedure in connection
with the horses and other cattle. &ldquo;When you reach home,&rdquo;
he wrote, &ldquo;I hope you will find the supplies and furniture which
I have sent on safe at the Hermitage. The pipe of Maderia wine
you will have placed on its stand and one-half gallon of best
French brandy put into it and after two or three days it will be
fit for use. You will have the old dining room newly papered for
Sarah&rsquo;s and your bedroom as it will be more convenient than upstairs;
but when she sees the house she can judge for herself. The
carpet in the portrait room shall be taken for that, and the one
in the parlor put in one of the rooms upstairs. Sarah will arrange
the rooms and furniture. If the supplies I have sent on reach home
in safety you will have an abundant supply of sugar, coffee,
Maderia and Sherry wines, etc. Salt and flour will be the only
articles to be laid in, but you will have now to begin to learn the
<span class="pb" id="Page_106">106</span>
wants of a family and supply it. This will require economy and
care, which you will have to learn and attend to if you expect to
get through life well&mdash;by always knowing your means and living
within them you will get well through life. This has been my rule
and I recommend it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sarah undoubtedly enjoyed her new r&ocirc;le of mistress of the
President&rsquo;s home place, and she immediately set about giving the
Hermitage that deft touch of feminine management which it had
lacked since Rachel&rsquo;s death. Within a few days she was writing
to the General about the need for a carpet for the dining room,
more table linen and some additional silverware for the table.
Jackson promptly attended to these matters, doubtless greatly
pleased at Sarah&rsquo;s interest in household affairs.</p>
<p>Sarah&rsquo;s interest in her new home, however, was apparently not
shared to any great extent by her husband. Jackson in his parting
memorandum had urged his son to write him fully about the
state of affairs on the farm; but Andrew neglected to do so, and
from that time forward Jackson&rsquo;s published correspondence reveals
clearly the difficulty he had in impressing on young Andrew
the importance of attending strictly to business and the apprehension
the absentee planter in Washington was caused by the
slack management of the plantation by the young man.</p>
<p>There were forebodings of trouble on this score from the very
first. As early as May 25, 1832, Overseer Steele wrote Jackson:
&ldquo;I have prest on Andrew to pay strict attention to the management
and manner in which your affairs has been conductied during
your absence but it appears that he don&rsquo;t take the least pride or
feel the least intrusted in the farm or aneything there pertaining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this very time Jackson was writing his son: &ldquo;I have no wish
to acquire wealth for myself. If I can add to your and Sarah&rsquo;s
comforts whilst I live and leave you comfortable and independent
of the world when I die, I am contented.&rdquo; A few days later he
wrote him: &ldquo;The jewelry of your dear mother is under your care.
Present to Sarah, with my affectionate regard, the pearl necklace,
ear rings, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>Andrew and Sarah were back in the East early in 1833 to visit
Jackson in the White House and Sarah&rsquo;s family in Philadelphia.
In July they accompanied the President and his party to the Rip
Raps in Hampton Roads for a summer vacation of six weeks, and
then after another visit in Philadelphia they were back at the
Hermitage in October. While in Philadelphia Andrew had instructed
one of his friends there to order a chest of tools for use
on the farm; and when the bill was presented to the President in
November he paid it and wrote Andrew the following revelatory
letter, one of the very few of his family letters in which the
sardonic note intrudes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My son: Inclosed you will find Mr. Toland&rsquo;s receipt to Mr. Brown for
the chest and tools laid in for you by your friend Mr. Hart, and Mr.
Brown&rsquo;s receipt for a check for $62.03 drew by me in his favor, being in
full for that bill. You will find the chest (from the price charged, a nice
piece of furniture for the parlour) not well suited to a negro&rsquo;s workshop;
and the tools very fine, such I suppose as cabinet-makers use. Be
this as it may, bought wit is the best&mdash;when not bought too dear; and I
could not permit either your feelings or character to suffer for the
amount of the bill; but I think that it will henceforth admonish you to
purchase your own tools for the farm and not entrust it to an agent.
Remember my advice, my son: Never purchase any useless article. Those
that are needed for your comfort or that of your dear little family purchase
always as far as you have the means; and be always certain, if you
wish to die independent, to keep your wants within your means; always,
when you have the money, paying for them when bought. I have said
before and now repeat: The world is not to be trusted. Many think you
rich, and many you will find under false pretensions of friendship would
involve you if they can, strip you of your last shilling and afterwards
laugh at your folly and distress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the ensuing years there must have been many times when
Andrew Jackson, junior, looked back on the sage advice embraced
in that letter and wished that he had indeed learned a lesson from
the injudicious purchase of the tool-chest suited for a parlor and
the tools such as cabinet makers use. He had plenty of &ldquo;bought
wit&rdquo; in the years to come; and most of it was, indeed, &ldquo;bought too
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrew also caused the old man considerable worry at this
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
time by having purchased a slave in Maryland before returning
to the Hermitage, paying only a part of the purchase price in
cash and leaving a balance due. He neglected to say anything to
Jackson about the unpaid balance, and he learned of it only when
the Maryland slavetrader dunned him for the money. This annoyed
and embarrassed Jackson, but his chief concern was evidently
not the money involved; he was worried about Andrew&rsquo;s
careless business habits. &ldquo;Why will you not, my dear Andrew,&rdquo; he
wrote him, &ldquo;attend to my admonition about money matters?&rdquo;
And, further, &ldquo;My son, at all times and on all occasions state to
your father things just as they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inattentive to these admonitions, however, Andrew gave further
cause for annoyance during that summer when he repurchased the
old Hunter&rsquo;s Hill property adjoining the Hermitage. Jackson had
consented that Andrew make the purchase if he thought it advisable,
encouraging the young man to take the initiative and make
the decision for himself; but he was particular to impress on
Andrew that he wanted him to have the terms of the sale reduced
to writing and a copy of the agreement forwarded to him. Nevertheless,
his first knowledge of the purchase was a draft drawn on
him for the first payment on the purchase price; and then began a
long succession of letters from father to son unsuccessfully seeking
to learn the exact details of the trade. Similarly, he was unable
to get from Andrew information as to the number of pounds of
cotton baled and shipped to New Orleans. &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; he wrote in
May, &ldquo;surely it is a duty that you would owe to an entire stranger,
surely more imperious to me, to acknowledge the receipt of such
business letters as these.&rdquo; And again, despairingly, in June: &ldquo;My
son, why will you not learn to transact your affairs like a man of
business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrew, apparently, was incorrigibly negligent about answering
letters; for in October, when Jackson had returned to Washington
after spending the summer at the Hermitage, he wrote
him: &ldquo;Thirty-one days have elapsed since we left the Hermitage,
Sarah on a sick bed. I had your promise that you would write me
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
how they were; and I am now, even now, without one line from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To add to the old General&rsquo;s worries at this stage of young Andrew&rsquo;s
career, there is strong evidence that he had reason to be
fearful of his son&rsquo;s falling into intemperate habits. Perhaps the
young wife conveyed the idea to the old man. At any rate, Sarah
went on a visit to Philadelphia early in April, 1835, leaving
Andrew at home, supposedly looking after the work of rebuilding
the burned Hermitage; and on April 14,1835, Jackson wrote
him a long and pointed fatherly letter concerning the evils of intemperance,
in the course of which he said: &ldquo;When I reflect on
the fate of your cousin Savern, brought on him by intemperance,
from being an honor to his friends reduced to the contempt of all
by his brutal intemperance, I shudder when I see any appearance
of it in any other branch of our connection. Your conduct, standing
as my representative, the son of the President, draws upon
you the eyes of the world, and the least deviation from the rules
of strict decorum and propriety are observed and commented
upon by all our enemies and those who envy you of your situation.
Added to this, your charming little wife and sweet little
ones&rsquo; respectability in society depends on your upright course in
your walks of life. This, my son, ought always to be before your
eyes, and I am sure must be; and your pledge to me on the point
of intemperance assures me that you never will permit spirits to
enter your lips again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few weeks later, taking as his text the experience of a Washington
friend who had been humiliated by public drunkenness,
Jackson wrote Andrew another letter of warning against &ldquo;intoxication,
which reduces the human being below that of the brute,&rdquo;
concluding his letter with: &ldquo;Oh, my son, if you were to be found
in such condition it would destroy me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These letters apparently had the desired effect, for Major
Lewis after visiting the Hermitage in May, 1835, wrote Jackson
that he was much gratified at the fine and healthy appearance of
the young man, that he looked like a different person; and, he concluded:
<span class="pb" id="Page_110">110</span>
&ldquo;I have no doubt he has faithfully complied with his
promise to you to the letter.&rdquo; Jackson, upon receipt of Major
Lewis&rsquo;s letter, wrote at once to Andrew telling him how delighted
he was at the favorable report of his good conduct and healthful
appearance and his good standing with everybody. &ldquo;This, my
son,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is more grateful to your dear father than all the
wealth of Peru, and I have now the greatest confidence in your
good conduct through life&rdquo;&mdash;which confidence, the future revealed,
was well placed.</p>
<p>Early in the summer of 1835 Andrew joined Sarah and the
children at the White House and they went with the President for
another vacation at the Rip Raps in July and August. They went
on a visit to Philadelphia in September, and late in that month
Andrew went back to the Hermitage, leaving Sarah to return to
Tennessee later. They were there at the Hermitage in the summer
of 1836 when Jackson came to look at his rebuilt home, but they
went to Philadelphia again in October and then for a final visit
to the White House. They left there with the worn-out ex-President
in March, 1837, and all returned to the Hermitage together.</p>
<p>At this time the son&rsquo;s little family consisted of his wife, Sarah,
and a little son and daughter: Andrew, III, born April 4, 1834;
and Rachel, born in 1832. Both the children were born at the Hermitage,
and they were a never-failing source of pleasure and comfort
to the old General in his declining years. Little Rachel was
his especial pet from the time she was born, and she was one of
those who stood by his bedside when he died.</p>
<p>Like every doting grandfather, he was inordinately proud of
her cunning little ways; and he chuckled as he related to his
friends how the little girl, upon her arrival at the White House
with her mother following the burning of the Hermitage, greeted
him with: &ldquo;Grandpa, the great fire burned my bonnet; and a big
owl tried to kill Poll, but Papa killed the owl.&rdquo; Needless to say,
Grandpa dropped all the affairs of State long enough to see that
little Rachel was supplied with a new bonnet without delay. And
he probably joined her in rejoicing over the narrow escape of old
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
Poll from the owl, for the old Hermitage parrot was a great pet
of the General&rsquo;s. In his letters home he inquired about her, and
William Donelson in writing to him in December, 1829, said:
&ldquo;Poor Poll is doing well. She is as fat and saucy as ever. From
her continued good health I think she will live to be an old bird.
Elizabeth desires to be remembered affectionately to you, and says
that she will insure Polly&rsquo;s life till you return.&rdquo; As a matter of
fact, the old bird outlived the General himself; and she distinguished
herself by introducing an element of the grotesque into
the solemnity of the funeral services when she suddenly startled
the assembled mourners by bursting into a loud torrent of profanity
which made it necessary to suspend proceedings until her
perch could be removed from the upper front portico to a more
remote vantage point.</p>
<p>Second only to his adopted son in General Jackson&rsquo;s affections
was Andrew Jackson Donelson, son of Samuel Donelson, one of
Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s brothers. Samuel had been Jackson&rsquo;s law partner in
his early days and he it was whose elopement Jackson had aided
back in 1797 when Samuel romantically stole his bride, Polly
Smith from the window of the &ldquo;Rock Castle&rdquo; home of her father,
General Daniel Smith&mdash;the same Daniel Smith who helped survey
the much disputed extension of the dividing line between
Virginia and North Carolina. The eloping couple had fled to
Jackson&rsquo;s near-by home at Hunter&rsquo;s Hill to have the wedding ceremony
performed; and, strangely enough, it was at the Hermitage
that Samuel died in 1802, death overtaking him there suddenly
one evening when he had stopped by to pay a fraternal visit. He
left three young sons&mdash;Andrew Jackson, Daniel and John&mdash;and
General Jackson was made the guardian of the eldest of the three,
his namesake. At first all three boys continued to live with their
mother at the home of her father, General Smith; but one day
when Jackson paid a visit to them, little Andrew returned to the
Hermitage with him, riding behind the General on his horse. He
came to spend a few days; but so firm a hold did he gain on Jackson&rsquo;s
affections that he was never sent home. From then on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
Hermitage was his home, and he was reared there with all the
love and care that could be shown one&rsquo;s own son.</p>
<p>Young Donelson was educated at Cumberland College (University
of Nashville), Transylvania University at Lexington, and
at West Point. Throughout his college life he was an outstanding
student, and at the Military Academy he distinguished himself
by finishing the four-year course in three years and graduating
second in his class. Upon his graduation he was appointed an
aide-de-camp to General Jackson, at the latter&rsquo;s special request,
and served with him in the Florida wars. After his return to Nashville
he practiced law for a short while, but soon abandoned this
and began to take an active and useful part in General Jackson&rsquo;s
political activities.</p>
<p>Jackson had a genuinely high regard for young Donelson.
&ldquo;I have reared and educated him as my son,&rdquo; he wrote a friend on
one occasion; and that the old General had the most unlimited
ambitions for him is shown by a letter he wrote to him while he
was at Transylvania College encouraging him to seek his associates
and friends among the better class of students and concluding:
&ldquo;I look forward, if you live, to the time when you will
be selected to preside over the destinies of America.&rdquo; Donelson
did not climb that high on the political ladder, but he did achieve
distinction in his own right in public affairs; and there were many
of his friends who thought that his star might have shone with
greater brilliance had it not been dimmed by the too-close effulgence
of his famous guardian and friend.</p>
<p>By the time Jackson was elected President in 1828 the young
man had reached such a place in his confidence and affection that
he was his spontaneous choice as private secretary, and he went
with him to Washington in this capacity. The Jackson administration,
however, had not been afloat very long before it ran on the
rocks of the Peggy Eaton embroglio, that tempest in a teapot that
threatened for a while to upset the government; and Major Donelson
and his wife became the storm centers of this furious affair.
Mrs. Donelson was a niece of Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s, the major having
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
married his own first cousin, Emily, daughter of Captain John
Donelson; and Jackson felt for her a very real avuncular affection
when he installed her as mistress of the White House. Red-headed
Miss Emily, however, was a spunky individual with a
spirit of her own; and, although she reluctantly consented to receive
Peggy Eaton coldly but courteously as an official guest at
the White House, she flatly refused to visit Mrs. Eaton or to have
any other social contacts with her. This brought about strained
relations in the White House family, but the affair was temporarily
kept from coming to a head; and the President and the
Donelsons returned in amity together to Tennessee to spend the
summer of 1830. There had almost been a flare-up before leaving
Washington. The Eatons had been invited to dine at the
White House, and the petulant Peggy had refused to enter the
house while the Donelsons were there, claiming that Emily had
publicly snubbed her a short while previously. This naturally
riled the General and he raised considerable of a rumpus. In his
flurry of anger he threatened to take the Donelsons home and
leave them there, and this threat got under the Donelsons&rsquo; skin.
Accordingly, when they all got back to Tennessee in June, the
Donelsons did not go to the Hermitage to stay but went to the
home of Mrs. Donelson&rsquo;s mother, then a widow. The Eatons made
a rather showy and carefully pre-arranged visit to Tennessee during
this summer, a feature of the trip being their entertainment
at the Hermitage; and Major Donelson later explained that he
and his wife went to Mrs. Donelson&rsquo;s to stay because they did
not want to put themselves in the way of the honors General Jackson
intended to pay to the Eatons at the Hermitage. But the President&rsquo;s
feelings were hurt. &ldquo;When I expected you and Emily to
go to my house and remain with me as part of my family, it was
declined,&rdquo; he wrote in a letter to Major Donelson that fall when
the two of them were back in Washington carrying on that childish
interchange of formal letters within the walls of the White
House which almost precipitated a crisis at that time.</p>
<p>Jackson smelt trouble brewing as early as July, when he mentioned
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
in a letter to Major Lewis from the Hermitage: &ldquo;It may
so happen that I shall return to the city in company with my son
alone,&rdquo; and asked the Major to be looking about for some eligible
man to serve as his secretary. &ldquo;My connections have acted very
strangely here,&rdquo; he wrote; adding, with characteristic fire: &ldquo;but
I know I can live as well without them as they can without me,
and I will govern my own household or I will have none.&rdquo; When
the time came to return to Washington in October, Mrs. Donelson
announced that she would spend the winter in Tennessee with
her widowed mother; and it is not recorded that General Jackson
interposed any violent objection to this program. Major Donelson,
however, went along with him.</p>
<p>Hardly had they got back to Washington before General Jackson
wrote back to Emily&rsquo;s sister, Mary Eastin, saying that &ldquo;Major
Donelson has informed me that the house appears lonesome; and
on his account it would give me great pleasure if you and Emily
and the sweet little ones were here.&rdquo; He went on to say, however:
&ldquo;Provided you will pursue my advice and assume that dignified
course that ought to have been at first adopted, of treating every
one with attention and extending the same comity and attention
to all the heads of Departments and their families.&rdquo; He told Miss
Eastin to convey this qualified invitation to Emily and he himself
told Major Donelson what he had written. Then ensued that absurd
and pathetic intramural correspondence between these two
strong-willed men who lived in the same house, worked together
daily in the close and confidential relations of a President and
his private secretary&mdash;but who fought out their private quarrel
by means of long, formal letters.</p>
<p>Jackson had a deep and sincere affection for Major Donelson,
but he felt that his honor was at stake; worse than that, he had
tortured the shabby controversy into a &ldquo;conspiracy&rdquo; to strike at
him through Eaton and through him at his departed Rachel.
Donelson, on the other hand, while his letters breathed love
and respect for his uncle, felt that his and his wife&rsquo;s dignity
and self-respect would not permit of any dictation as to their
social contacts.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>So matters rocked along, and in December Jackson wrote General
Coffee that Donelson&rsquo;s &ldquo;demeanor toward Major Eaton is
more free.&rdquo; He kept up a friendly correspondence with Emily
back in Tennessee, and wrote Coffee that he expected her to come
on to Washington in March or April. Major Donelson wrote his
wife in January, 1831, that he had had &ldquo;a very satisfactory conversation
with Uncle in relation to our social difficulty&rdquo; and that &ldquo;He
has left to my own discretion the period of your return, without
alluding to the influence which produced your stay in Tennessee.&rdquo;
The Major expressed great gratification at the prospect of getting
things patched up, and on March 8th left Washington for Nashville
to get his little family and take them back to the White House
with him.</p>
<p>Late in March, however, the Eaton affair boiled over in Washington
again, and some new developments there made the President
furious. On March 24th he wrote a long letter to Major
Donelson, couched in words of genuine affection but reflecting
plainly his agitation. The partially healed sore was reopened and
he candidly said: &ldquo;As much as I desire you and your dear little
family with me, unless you and yours can harmonize with Major
Eaton and his family, I do not wish you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This new crisis in the Eaton affair resulted in the resignations
of Van Buren and Eaton from the Cabinet, and Jackson hastily
wrote Donelson on April 19th telling him of these resignations
and predicting that &ldquo;you will find an entire new Cabinet when you
arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now the Donelsons were offended. Upset by the strong
words of Jackson&rsquo;s letter of March 24th they, as General Coffee
expressed it, &ldquo;fear that you require more than they can consistently
comply with.&rdquo; In reply to this letter Donelson wrote a reply
which Jackson styled &ldquo;a vindictive phillippic,&rdquo; the general tenor
of which was that he could not return with his wife under the
terms set forth in Jackson&rsquo;s communication. Jackson&rsquo;s reply was
firm, though tempered with expressions of his affection, and
showed clearly the extent to which the controversy had upset him.
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
His letter concluded: &ldquo;I am laboured almost to death, and have
been a good deal afflicted; but will try amongst strangers to get
a man who will aid me and who will think it no disgrace to associate
with me and my friends.&rdquo; This must have cut Donelson to
the quick, but it did not alter his determination to sever his official
relations with his godfather, the President. He went back
to Washington&mdash;alone&mdash;to wind up his personal affairs there; and
before leaving finally, on June 18th, he wrote an affectionate note
to Jackson giving &ldquo;assurance of my readiness to resume the relation
which I have maintained near you for so many years, whenever
you think that my services can be of any avail.&rdquo; In a letter
written home to his wife he told of a long conversation he had
had with Jackson, and dropped the strange comment that &ldquo;After
what has now passed, while our duty remains the same, I am
almost as well satisfied that the view which Uncle takes is correct.&rdquo;
Nevertheless, he went on home; and Jackson engaged as
his private secretary Mr. Nicholas P. Trist (whose wife was a
granddaughter of Thomas Jefferson), and he served until the
reconciliation with the Donelsons.</p>
<p>The reconciliation, as might have been expected where there
was so much mutual love and esteem, was not long in coming.
Jackson kept up a friendly correspondence with Andrew and
Emily as though nothing had happened, and in July two Nashville
friends, John C. McLemore and John Bell, took it upon themselves
to act to bring Jackson and Donelson back together. They
talked to the Major, read all the letters the President had written
to him, and then gave him the sensible advice to pack up his
family and return to the White House &ldquo;without further correspondence.&rdquo;
They wrote Jackson that they had given Donelson
this advice and stated further that &ldquo;we think there is no necessity
for the specification of terms on one side or the other.&rdquo; That this
effort of the peacemakers was at length successful is shown by a
single reference in one of Jackson&rsquo;s letters to Coffee on September
6th: &ldquo;Major Donelson and his little family reached here yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>Thus ended the spat between General Jackson and the Donelsons;
and in all their future relations there was never anything to
suggest that there had ever been the slightest asperity between
them. Mischief-making Peggy Eaton drove them apart; but even
she, with her genius for creating dissention, could not keep them
apart.</p>
<p>In 1818 Major Donelson had inherited from his father a handsome
plantation called Tulip Grove which lies directly across the
Lebanon Road from the Hermitage; and in 1834 General Jackson,
perhaps to seal the reconciliation, engaged Messrs. Reiff and
Hume to build on it the handsome residence which still stands
there. Emily, the innocent stormy petrel, died December, 1836,
of tuberculosis. The disease wasted her strength rapidly and she
died before her husband could get back from Washington where
he had gone to help wind up the affairs of the Jackson administration
under the impression that she was not dangerously ill.
Major Donelson later married another of his cousins, herself the
widow of Lewis Randolph of Virginia, who was a grandson of
Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p>Major Donelson, after Jackson&rsquo;s administration closed went
back to Tulip Grove and lived the life of a farmer for a few
years, keeping in touch with Uncle Jackson across the road and
helping him sometimes with his flood of correspondence. By
President Tyler he was appointed charge de affairs to the Republic
of Texas, and he played an active and able part in promoting
the annexation of the Lone Star State. When James K. Polk was
elected President he was made minister to Prussia, an office which
he filled with ability and distinction. Following this service he
became editor of the <i>Washington Union</i>; and in 1856 took his last
fling at politics when he was a candidate for Vice President on
the ticket with Millard Fillmore. He died on June 26, 1871.</p>
<p>Major Donelson ever stood high in the affections of Andrew
Jackson, and when the old statesman made his will in 1843 he
left to him the gorgeous gold-encrusted sword which had been
presented to him on July 4, 1822, by the State of Tennessee in
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
honor of his services in the War of 1812. This priceless heirloom
is still in the possession of Mrs. Bettie M. Donelson of Nashville,
widow of Major Donelson&rsquo;s son Alexander. There is a note of
pathos in the apologetic explanatory clause embraced in the paragraph
of the will in which this bequest is made: &ldquo;This, from the
great change in my worldly affairs of late, is, with my blessing,
all I can bequeath him&rdquo;; but, the dying General added: &ldquo;This
bequest is made as a memento of the high regard, affection and
esteem I bear for him as a high-minded, honest and honorable
man.&rdquo; And, since a good name is rather to be chosen than great
riches, what more precious bequest could anyone receive?</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * *</span></p>
<p>Andrew Jackson Donelson was not by any means General Jackson&rsquo;s
only ward. Another namesake and relative of his wife&rsquo;s who
was bequeathed to him and who was brought up at the Hermitage
was Andrew Jackson Hutchings, orphan son of his old partner
in the mercantile business, John Hutchings, who died in Alabama
in November, 1817. The elder Hutchings was then a widower,
and when he knew that death was upon him he sent for his old
partner and asked him to consent to act as guardian to the little
five-year-old boy he was leaving behind him. Jackson took the
boy (&ldquo;little Hutchings&rdquo; he generally called him in his letters about
him), and carefully reared him at the Hermitage, giving him every
possible attention and advantage.</p>
<p>When Jackson went to Florida in 1821 he did not take Hutchings
with him, the reason assigned, in a letter to John Coffee, being
a strange one: &ldquo;I am aware if I did and an accident happen his
grandfather would believe I had destroyed him that his estate
should go to his father&rsquo;s family.&rdquo; So he engaged a combination
nurse and tutor to take up her residence at the Hermitage during
his absence and keep the boy at his studies; and in his letters home
from Florida he never neglected to inquire about the lad&rsquo;s health
and send him messages. &ldquo;Say to him his cousin Andrew will bring
him a pretty present when he returns, and I will buy him a pony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hutchings, as the years passed on, developed into a rather
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
difficult subject. Jackson had hardly arrived at the White House
in March, 1829, heart-broken over his wife&rsquo;s recent death and
naturally worried over the tremendous burden of responsibility
he was taking on his shoulders, when news reached him that the
boy had been suspended from the University of Nashville. Much
perturbed, he wrote to William Donelson asking him to send
Hutchings to the school conducted by Mr. Otey at Franklin. &ldquo;I
wish him taught penmanship, arithmetic and bookkeeping, algebra
and some of the other branches of mathematics, moral philosophy,
belles letters and such other branches that may be profitable
to him as a farmer and private gentleman. I have lost all
hope of making him a classic scholar, and do not wish him to
touch the languages except to review those books of Latin and
Greek that he has read, but wish him to understand his grammar
well.&rdquo; He also wrote Hutchings directly that he wished him to
enter the school at Franklin, but Hutchings was having too good
a time back home at the Hermitage where there was no restraining
hand save that of the overseer, and he began to parley about
a choice of schools, claiming that he had an aversion to Mr. Otey&rsquo;s
school and would prefer to go to one conducted by Mr. Williford
at Columbia. While all this was going on, Jackson&rsquo;s friend Colonel
Charles J. Love visited the Hermitage and wrote: &ldquo;Young Hutchings
is very much in the way at the Hermitage. He rode one of
the brood mares away the other day and got her eyes put out. A
letter from you might be of service. Mr. Steel is anxious he should
leave the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hutchings finally went off to the Columbia school, but did not
last long there. In July Jackson wrote General Coffee, who was
helping him manage the boy&rsquo;s estate: &ldquo;His conduct has filled me
with sincere regret. I can not think of letting him be lost, and
have concluded to bring him here and place him at the college
at George Town under the control of the Catholics. It is an excellent
university and perhaps, under my own eye, I might be able
to control him and convince him of the impropriety of his ways.&rdquo;
Accordingly he came on to Washington when Andrew, junior, returned
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
from a visit to the Hermitage a little later; but in April
Jackson sent him back to Mr. Williford&rsquo;s school at Columbia.
&ldquo;Hutchings has behaved well at college,&rdquo; he wrote Coffee, &ldquo;but
he has such a great dislike to this place and his health not good
that I have consented to let him return under a promise that he will
abandon his extravagance.&rdquo; But after he had left Washington
Jackson found that he had left a lot of bills unpaid, and he instructed
Coffee to &ldquo;notify everyone that no accounts will be paid
only those authorized by you. This will be necessary to preserve
him from bankruptcy and ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of going back to Columbia to school, however, Hutchings
simply went back to the Hermitage and began to idle his
time away again. Before long Jackson had a letter from Overseer
Steele complaining of &ldquo;a quarrel and fight&rdquo; he had had with
Hutchings over the youth&rsquo;s desire to whip a slave who had offended
him; and again the harrassed guardian had to write to
Coffee asking him to use his influence to get the boy to go back to
school. &ldquo;At the Hermitage he is to have a home, but I expect he
will aid in keeping peace rather than be its disturber,&rdquo; Jackson
wrote.</p>
<p>Hutchings apparently never did go back to school at Columbia,
but in September turned up in Washington again and wheedled
Jackson into sending him to the University of Virginia. &ldquo;He says
he is now determined to become a learned man,&rdquo; the hopeful
Jackson wrote Coffee; and for a brief time it appeared that there
might be something to this hope, for the boy&rsquo;s professors reported
his good conduct early in October. In November Jackson wrote
him reproving him for not fulfilling his promise to write to him
every week, but inviting him to come and spend the Christmas
holidays with him at the White House. Hutchings accordingly
came, and the President rounded off the holidays by permitting
him to go to Philadelphia to visit his cousin, Miss Mary McLemore
of Nashville, who was in school there and with whom he thought
he had fallen in love.</p>
<p>By February, 1832, the boy&rsquo;s determination to become a learned
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
man had faded away. By absenting himself from his classes he
laid himself liable to dismissal, and to escape this ignominy he
withdrew from the school. Jackson was much chagrined and
humiliated when notified of this state of affairs, but derived such
consolation as he could from the fact that his ward was accused
of no moral delinquency. He urged Hutchings to come to Washington;
but the young man was evidently ashamed to face his
guardian, and so wrote to General Coffee asking him to send him
enough money to return to his farm in Alabama which had been
left him by his father. Coffee sent the money, but instead of going
to Alabama to take up the life of a farmer, Hutchings was back
at the Hermitage again in April&mdash;and again causing trouble, this
time in connection with the handling of some colts.</p>
<p>It was no doubt with a distinct feeling of relief that the harassed
President was at last able to relinquish his guardianship in March,
1833, when Hutchings came of age. In writing to General Coffee,
instructing him about turning over the young man&rsquo;s patrimony
to him, Jackson said: &ldquo;I know I have performed my pledges to
his father on his dying bed&rdquo;; and in a letter to Hutchings he gave
him some kindly and wholesome advice about the manner in
which he should conduct himself.</p>
<p>Despite all the trouble he had had with him, however, Jackson
seemed to have a real feeling of high regard for the orphan boy,
son of his old partner and grandson of his wife&rsquo;s sister Catherine;
and he kept up a fatherly correspondence with him all the rest
of his life. A significant sidelight on Jackson&rsquo;s high principles
in such matters is revealed by his response when Hutchings, checking
over the accounting of his estate noticed that there was no
charge made for administration and wrote Jackson notifying him
of the supposed oversight. &ldquo;I have no charge against your estate,&rdquo;
Jackson wrote him, &ldquo;I never charged an orphan one cent for either
time or expense, and I shall not now begin with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson took a particular interest in the progress of his ex-ward&rsquo;s
love affairs. His affection for his cousin Mary McLemore
having cooled, Hutchings upon settling down on his farm in
<span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
Alabama fell in love with another cousin, General Coffee&rsquo;s
daughter Mary; and Jackson, obviously in favor of the match,
helped it along with encouragement to the swain and an occasional
adroit word of commendation for Hutchings when he was
writing to Mary. They were married on November 14, 1833.
Jackson wrote warm letters of congratulation to both of them;
and, as early as June, 1834, he was writing Hutchings: &ldquo;You have
not even hinted whether a cradle will be necessary to compleat the
furniture of your house. Do inform me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson Hutchings, his harum-scarum young days behind
him, developed into a responsible and respected citizen and
planter. Jackson kept in touch with him through correspondence
and occasional visits, and he enjoyed great gratification at Hutchings&rsquo;s
success in establishing himself as a substantial and respected
man. When Hutchings, following the death of his wife in 1840,
went to Cuba in an effort to restore his own health, Jackson wrote
a letter of introduction in which he described him as &ldquo;a gentleman
of the highest principles of honor and honesty.&rdquo; The trip to
Cuba, however, was ineffectual, and Hutchings returned to Alabama
to die in January, 1841.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * *</span></p>
<p>Donelson and Hutchings were but two of the numerous children
Jackson took into the Hermitage and brought up as his own.
A complete roster of them would be a long list. Apparently Jackson&rsquo;s
friends had a habit of dying and leaving their orphans to
his care. His old friend Edward Butler, for instance, appointed
the General guardian of his two sons and two daughters when he
died in 1804, and there were other odd children left under his
wing from time to time. But Rachel had a heart big enough to
find room for them all; and Jackson, despite his engrossing responsibilities
and his excruciating headaches, never objected to
their noisy play as they tumbled about in the Hermitage while
he was talking business and politics with his numerous visitors.</p>
<p>An exotic and pitiful member of the Hermitage household for
a few years was Lyncoya, the young Indian whom General Jackson
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
rescued from the Creek battlefield of Tallushatches in November,
1813. When this bloody battle was over, this year-old
infant boy was found at the breast of his dead mother, lying on
the field. The baby was brought by John Coffee to the tent of
General Jackson who sought to have some of the surviving Indian
women take it and nurse it. With savage indifference they refused
to make any effort to save the baby&rsquo;s life; indeed, they sullenly
suggested that the baby might as well be killed since its parents
had already been slaughtered by the whites. General Jackson,
however, determined to take it upon himself to see that the little
waif survived. Accordingly he had it fed regularly on brown
sugar and water and bread crumbs, and on this rude fare it survived
until it could be sent back to civilization and given proper
diet and attention. First the baby was sent to Huntsville, to be
cared for there by Colonel LeRoy Pope; and it was his daughter,
so tradition says, who conferred the name Lyncoya on the child.
At last the little Indian reached the Hermitage, and under the
kindly Rachel&rsquo;s care soon bloomed with health again. General
Jackson had written home that he was sending the little Indian
as a present to little Andrew&mdash;much as one would speak of sending
a puppy or lamb or some other form of pet. &ldquo;I wish to know
if little Andrew got his little Lyncoya and what he thinks of him,&rdquo;
the General wrote later to Rachel; and in all of his subsequent
letters home he had something to say about the derelict Indian
baby. &ldquo;How is Lyncoya?&rdquo; he wrote to Rachel from Mobile late
in 1814. &ldquo;Although he is a heathen he is an orphan, and I know
you will extend a motherly care over him.&rdquo; And Rachel did.</p>
<p>The exact status of Lyncoya in the Hermitage menage is now
not entirely clear. General Jackson probably shared the frontier
sentiment that an Indian was just barely a human being, and at
first he seems to have looked upon him as little more than a novel
sort of pet for little Andrew. But the young redskin must have
grown in Old Hickory&rsquo;s affections, for in subsequent letters he
refers to &ldquo;my little sons, including Lyncoya,&rdquo; and as soon as he
was old enough he went to school along with the white boys.
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
Lyncoya, according to tradition, soon showed signs of his racial
origin: He decorated his head with turkey feathers, and with a
bow and arrow that he made for himself he kept the chicken yard
in an uproar. As he grew older, General Jackson&rsquo;s plans for him
grew more ambitious. In 1823 he wrote from Washington to Mrs.
Jackson: &ldquo;I would be delighted to receive a letter from our son,
little Hutchings and even Lyncoya. The latter I would like to
exhibit to Mr. Monroe and the Secretary of War, as I mean to
have him received at the Military School as early as I can.&rdquo; But
by the time Lyncoya was old enough to enter the Military Academy
the national administration had changed and Jackson&rsquo;s enemies
were in power. Accordingly, the General decided to have
the young Indian learn a trade, and so took him to Nashville and
carried him around town so that he could see with his own eyes
men working in the various shops, and then let him decide which
one was most attractive to him. Lyncoya for some reason (and
by a strange coincidence, since Jackson himself had worked in
his boyhood at the same trade) chose the shop of a saddler as
the scene of his future labors. So he was apprenticed to a Nashville
saddle maker in 1827; but it was his custom to spend his
Sundays at the Hermitage, riding one of the General&rsquo;s fine saddle
horses to and from Nashville. The confinement of the shop, however,
did not agree with him and within a year he fell ill with a
heavy cold that settled on his lungs. He was given permission to
go home to the Hermitage, where he was carefully nursed by Mrs.
Jackson, but he grew gradually worse and died June 1, 1828&mdash;his
being the first death to occur in the Hermitage. Just where he
was buried nobody seems to know. At least one chronicle has
stated that he was buried in the garden; but, if so, there is no sign
of it. No stone there bears his name, and there is no unmarked
grave in the family plot. It has also been suggested that he was
probably buried in the slaves&rsquo; graveyard down in the thicket, back
of the carriage house. But all this is mere conjecture.</p>
<p>Lyncoya must have been a problem to General Jackson who, in
common with other pioneers, hated the Indians as a race, although
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
he apparently had nothing but affection and pity for the forlorn
individual he had brought to live under his own roof. That he
trusted him implicity is shown by a brief note in Jackson&rsquo;s handwriting
now in the possession of a Nashville connection: &ldquo;Mr.
John Summerville will please send me by Lyncoya, who will hand
him this, fifty dollars in small notes. Please enclose it under cover
to me and oblige your friend Andrew Jackson.&rdquo; Mr. Summerville
lived in Nashville, and if Jackson had not had the greatest
confidence in him he would never have sent a thirteen-year-old
boy on that long, lonesome horseback ride to Nashville and back
to get that money.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * *</span></p>
<p>An almost lifelong resident of the Hermitage, described by
General Jackson as &ldquo;my friend and companion&rdquo; was Ralph E. W.
Earl, the artist who married Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s niece. He was born
in 1788, the son of Ralph Earl, an artist of distinction; and, following
his father&rsquo;s example, took up the profession of artist himself.
He came to Nashville in 1816, and through painting Jackson&rsquo;s
portrait established an acquaintance with the General which
ripened into lifelong friendship. One of his friends in a contemporaneous
letter described him as &ldquo;the very soul of goodness and
honor&rdquo;; and that seems to have been the general opinion of him.</p>
<p>While in Natchez exhibiting a portrait of Jackson which he had
painted, Earl met Miss Jane Caffery, a daughter of Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s
sister Mary, whom he married after a short courtship. Upon their
return to Nashville they were invited to live at the Hermitage,
and when Mrs. Earl died a few months afterwards, Jackson insisted
that Earl continue his residence there. From then until his
death he was the intimate friend of General Jackson, going to
Washington with him when he was elected President, and accompanying
him as a companion on most of his travels.</p>
<p>During the latter part of his life Earl spent most of his time
painting portraits of Jackson, and came to be known in a jesting
way as the &ldquo;court painter.&rdquo; It was intimated around political circles
in Washington that Earl&rsquo;s influence on the President was such
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
that his friendship was a good thing to have; and it was hinted
that Earl received many commissions to paint Jackson&rsquo;s picture
from practical men who were less interested in having a hand-painted
portrait of the President than they were in currying favor
with him. Be that as it may, Earl enjoyed painting the picture of
his old friend and benefactor and Jackson enjoyed Earl&rsquo;s companionship;
so everybody was happy. Earl is described by his contemporaries
as a man of quiet and gentle ways, and he must have
been an excellent foil for the fiery old General.</p>
<p>That he was not without a streak of humor is shown by his skylarking
when President Jackson left him in Washington when he
returned to the Hermitage in the summer of 1836. He was entrusted
with the duty, during Jackson&rsquo;s absence, of opening the
President&rsquo;s mail and distributing the letters to the proper departments.
Earl, with dry wit, remarked to Francis P. Blair that this
would place on the Cabinet members the unusual responsibility of
attending to their own duties; and there was a good deal of chaffing
and carrying-on in the official family while the well-liked
pseudo-President was occupying the chair in the White House
office with mock gravity. Earl would joke the Cabinet members
by seriously referring to them all of the incoherent letters of rattle-brained
cranks, including an inventor of a perpetual motion machine
who wrote him from the Philadelphia lunatic asylum; and
when one of them jokingly objected to being so annoyed, Earl
remarked that while he was sitting in the President&rsquo;s chair he was
tempted to go ahead and make some needed changes in the government
and thus save Mr. Van Buren (the heir apparent) the
trouble. Blair thought all of this great sport and wrote to Jackson
back at the Hermitage telling him all about it. &ldquo;He is thus playing
the part of Sancho Panzo,&rdquo; chuckled Blair, &ldquo;with those whom
he ventures to joke with, making some pretty good hits.&rdquo; Jackson
was never much of a hand for horse play and buffoonery; but if
he had any objection to all this pranking of Colonel Earl&rsquo;s he
never voiced it.</p>
<p>Upon the expiration of Jackson&rsquo;s term as President Earl returned
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
to the Hermitage with him, but did not live long. In addition
to being an artist he was also a dabbler in the art of landscape
gardening. He had designed the concentric flower beds in
the middle of the garden; and when Jackson in the summer of
1837 started to build the guitar-shaped driveway from the gate
to the front door of the Hermitage it was Earl who drew the plans
and helped supervise the work. The sun shines fiercely in Tennessee
in early September, and while engaged in this work Earl
suffered a heat stroke which passed into a congestive chill from
which he never recovered. He died on September 16, 1838, leaving
uncompleted a portrait on which he was working of Jackson
in his major-general&rsquo;s uniform. In writing to his former secretary,
Nicholas P. Trist, notifying him of Earl&rsquo;s death Jackson said:
&ldquo;His death is a severe bereavement to me. He was my sincere
friend and constant companion, and when I was able to travel
always accompanied me. He was an invaluable friend, a most
upright and honest man; but he is gone to happier climes than
these &lsquo;where the wicked cease to trouble and the weary are at
rest.&rsquo;&rdquo; Earl was buried in the family plot in the corner of the
garden, and Jackson made his little niche in history secure by
directing that there be engraved on his headstone the words:
&ldquo;Friend and companion of General Andrew Jackson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the journal of a Nashville citizen of that era, Mr. Matthew
Delamere Cooper, the funeral of Colonel Earl is commemorated
in a quaint and touching poem which he has entitled &ldquo;The
Burial,&rdquo; in introducing which he says: &ldquo;That the following lines
may be understood it is necessary to mention that they were written
on the occasion of the burial of Colonel Earl, a portrait painter
of considerable eminence, for many years the intimate friend of
General Jackson and long an inmate of the General&rsquo;s house. He
was followed to the grave by a few friends, amongst them the
venerable hero, who did honor to his memory and consecrated
the accumulating heap over his remains by a few tears that would
not be represt. The man of iron soul, the hero of a hundred
battles, wept over his departed friend! He was buried near a
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
weeping willow and within a few feet of the cenotaph destined
to receive the mortal remains of Andrew Jackson. (May it long
be an empty tomb!!)&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of history&rsquo;s shadowy figures who lived at the Hermitage
for the better part of two years was Major Henry Lee of Virginia,
scapegrace son of General Henry (Lighthorse Harry) Lee by his
first wife. As his father&rsquo;s eldest son Major Lee had become the
master of Stratford Hall, the seat of the Lee family in Virginia;
but as the result of an amour with his wife&rsquo;s sister he had been
forced to leave Stratford and exile himself beyond the boundaries
of his native state. Attracted by the rising star of General Jackson,
under whom he had served in the War of 1812, he came to
Nashville to seek a connection with him; and Jackson, despite the
social stigma attached to the expatriated Virginian, gave him
asylum and gave him secretarial employment.</p>
<p>Major Lee&rsquo;s polished diction is to be seen in many of Jackson&rsquo;s
formal state papers of this period, notably his first inaugural;
and during the campaign of 1828 he wrote copiously in behalf
of the General&rsquo;s candidacy. He was on Jackson&rsquo;s staff at the time
of Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s death; and tradition has it that he was the author
of the gem-like epitaph inscribed on her tomb. When the Indian
boy, Lyncoya, died in 1828 Lee wrote a tribute to him which appeared
in one of the Nashville daily papers and was greatly admired
at the time.</p>
<p>When President Jackson was inaugurated in 1829 Major Lee
aspired to be the chief clerk in the Department of State, an office
for which his talents and education eminently well fitted him; but
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
the black sheep son of Lighthorse Harry (&ldquo;Black Harry&rdquo; he was
sometimes called) by reasons of his indiscretion in Virginia had
made some powerful enemies there. They went to Washington
and waged a vigorous and successful fight against his being elevated
to such a high place in the Federal government, and so his
ambition in this direction was thwarted. Jackson then appointed
him to a diplomatic post in Algiers, and Lee went there to take
over the duties of this office; but his Virginia enemies were relentless
and succeeded in preventing the Senate&rsquo;s confirmation of
this appointment. Major Lee left Algiers and went to Paris, where
he died a few years later. He planned to write a biography of
Jackson and actually completed a part of the manuscript; but
after his death this uncompleted manuscript could never be
found.</p>
<p>It is of passing interest to observe that Robert E. Lee, the Confederate
commander, was appointed to the Military Academy at
West Point by President Jackson in 1829; and it is not improbable
that this appointment was the direct result of his elder half-brother&rsquo;s
friendship with the President.</p>
<p>A charming impression of the Hermitage household is recorded
in the book of recollections written in 1872 by Governor Henry
A. Wise of Virginia who, as few people now recall, spent his
honeymoon in the Jackson home. Henry Wise, a promising young
barrister, in August, 1828 came to Nashville from his home in
Virginia for the purpose of marrying the daughter of Dr. O.
Jennings, pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Nashville attended
by General Jackson and his wife when they were in the
city. Dr. Jennings was not only their pastor but their close personal
friend; and so, with characteristic hospitality, the Jacksons
insisted that the young couple must spend their honeymoon at
their country home.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>&ldquo;We arrived at the Hermitage to dinner,&rdquo; writes Governor
Wise, &ldquo;and were shown to a bridal chamber magnificently furnished
with articles which were the rich and costly presents of the
city of New Orleans to its noble defender. The first or second
evening of our stay, Mr. Lee had drawn about him his usual
crowd of listeners; but we were the more special guests of Mrs.
Jackson. She was a descendant of Colonel Charles Stockley, of
our native county, Accomack, Virginia; and we had often seen
his old mansion, an old Hanoverian hip-roofed house standing
on the seaside not far from Metompkin; and she had often heard
her mother talk of the old Assawaman Church, not far above
Colonel Stockley&rsquo;s house. Thus she was not only a good Presbyterian,
whose pastor&rsquo;s daughter was the bride, and she a Presbyterian
too, but the groom was from the county of her ancestors in
Virginia and could tell her something about traditions she had
heard of the family from which she sprung. With pious devotion
to her mother&rsquo;s family she desired to have a talk with us particularly,
and formed a cosy group of quiet chat in the northeast
corner room leading to the garden. This room had a north window,
diagonal from the door leading to the garden. At this door
her group was formed, fronting in a semi-circle the north window
of the room, the garden door on our right. First, on our right,
next the window, was old Judge Overton, one of General Jackson&rsquo;s
earliest and best friends. He was a man who had made his
mark in law and politics, but was not pious and was a queer-looking
little old man. Small in stature and cut into sharp angles
at every salient point; a round, prominent, gourd-like, bald
cranium; a peaked Roman nose; a prominent, sharp but manly
chin; and he had lost his teeth and swallowed his lips. Next to
him, on his left, sat General Jackson, his hair always standing
straight up and out, but he in his mildest mood of social suavity.
On his left the Reverend Doctor Jennings, one of the sweetest
men in society, very distinguished as a lawyer first and then as a
divine, with a rare sense of humor which even his religious zeal
could not always repress, and yet awfully earnest and severe
against all levity. On his left was Mrs. Jackson, a lady who doubtless
was once a form of rotund and rubicund beauty, but now was
very plethoric and obese and seemingly suffered from what was
called phthisis, and talked low but quick with a short and wheezing
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
breath, the very personification of affable kindness and of a
welcome as sincere and truthful as it was simple and tender. On
her left was ourself, responding to her every inquiry about things
her mother had handed down concerning the Stockley family;
and on our left sat Henry Baldwin, the son of Judge Baldwin of
the Supreme Court of the United States, one of the groomsmen, a
gentleman of fine culture, good sense and taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clearly the Jackson household was an attractive one and a
pleasant one to visit. No wonder the Hermitage was always full
of guests!</p>
<p>Henry Wise and his wife recalled with sadness that happy
scene in the northeast room when they were back there from
Nashville just a few months later to attend the funeral of Mrs.
Jackson, held in that same room where they had all been so merry
but a short time before.</p>
<p>The death of General Jackson&rsquo;s deeply beloved wife was
doubly tragic, coming as it did so closely in the wake of his triumphant
campaign for the Presidency in 1828, and hastened as it
unquestionably was by the heartless and slanderous attacks that
were made on her character by Jackson&rsquo;s political enemies in their
desperate attempt to defeat his candidacy.</p>
<p>Her health had been increasingly bad for four or five years.
She suffered from asthma and from palpitation of the heart, and
the excitement and humiliation of the savage political campaign
had aggravated her trouble, although she was not bedridden.
Her final and fatal seizure came suddenly on December 17th
while she was standing in her sitting room talking with Aunt
Hannah concerning some of the household affairs. The General,
who was in the fields, was hastily summoned, doctors were called,
relatives and friends hurried in. For sixty hours she suffered intensely,
and during all this time her adoring husband never left
her bedside. At length she grew better; and her first thought was
to reassure the General as to her improved condition and to urge
him to get some sleep so that he would be in proper condition for
the great banquet of triumph that was scheduled to be held in
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
Nashville by his political admirers in honor of his election to the
Presidency. The General at first refused to leave her side, but on
the evening of the 22nd she seemed so greatly improved and she
begged him so earnestly to get some rest that he reluctantly relaxed
his vigil and retired to the room across the hall. Hardly had
he left the sick room when the end came suddenly and without
warning. With only one spasmodic cry she died in the arms of the
faithful Aunt Hannah who was close by her side.</p>
<p>General Jackson was almost paralyzed with grief. He refused
to believe her dead, and persistently urged the doctors to try
every known restorative. But the doctors knew that life had left
her body and ordered her laid out on a table in the old-fashioned
way. &ldquo;Spread four blankets on the table,&rdquo; the General thoughtfully
admonished the servants, tears streaming down his face.
&ldquo;Then if she does come to, she won&rsquo;t lie so hard on it.&rdquo; All
through the night he sat there by her side. At intervals he would
feel of her heart and pulse and look hopefully into her face for
some sign of life. And all through the next day he sat there, utterly
inconsolable.</p>
<p>The death of Mrs. Jackson, of course, put an end to the gala
preparations in Nashville for the banquet of triumph. Handbills
announcing her passing were hastily printed and distributed
throughout the town; resolutions of regret and sympathy were
adopted by the city officials, and the committee on arrangements
for the banquet recommended a cessation of all business activities
in Nashville in deference to the bereaved President-elect. Army
officers in the city arrayed in their dress uniforms to participate
in the celebration laid aside their regalia of festivity and donned
the badges of mourning.</p>
<p>On the day of the funeral, it is recorded, every vehicle in Nashville
was pressed into service in conveying the residents of the
city to the Hermitage. Church bells in the city tolled steadily from
1:00 to 2:00 o&rsquo;clock <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, the hour of the services. Parton quotes
an attendant at the funeral as saying: &ldquo;Such a scene I never wish
to witness again. The poor old gentleman was supported to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
grave by General Coffee and Major Rutledge. I never pitied any
person more in my life. The road to the Hermitage was almost
impassable, and an immense number of persons attended the
funeral. I never before saw so much affliction among servants on
the death of a mistress. Some seemed completely stupefied by the
event; others wrung their hands and shrieked aloud. The woman
who waited on Mrs. Jackson had to be carried off the ground.&rdquo;
This was old Aunt Hannah who, between her sobs, said: &ldquo;She
was more than a mistis to us all; she was a mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The day of the funeral was cold and damp and drizzly and
the ground was muddy. The walkway leading from the house to
the new grave in the garden was covered with cotton from the
plantation gin-house to afford a firm footing to the pall-bearers
and the funeral cortege. But in spite of the mud and the rain, the
garden and yard were crowded with friends and neighbors. One
of those at the funeral says: &ldquo;More sincere homage was done to
her dead than was ever done to any woman in our day and country
living.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Jackson was heart-broken and stunned by his bereavement.
Friends observed a complete change in his demeanor from
that day forward. &ldquo;He aged twenty years in a night,&rdquo; said one observer;
and all agreed that he was not only marked by a visible
sadness but was from that time notably less violent in his nature
and in his conversation. But, despite his feeling of desolation, the
demands of the high office to which he had been elected did not
permit him to sit at home and nurse his grief; and so in January,
1829, he left the Hermitage for Washington to be inaugurated
President, accompanied by Andrew Jackson Donelson and Emily,
Henry Lee, and Major W. B. Lewis.</p>
<p>After the trunks had been packed and the coach brought
around to the front door, the heart-broken old General paid one
last visit alone to the little mound in the corner of the garden.
From a willow by the springhouse he cut four shoots and planted
them at the four corners of the grave plot; then, after standing a
moment with bared and bowed head, he turned and walked
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
slowly to the waiting coach. Before stepping up into the carriage,
so old Alfred used to tell, he turned for a farewell look at the
Hermitage. With tears in his eyes he took off his hat and made a
courtly bow of farewell to the old house, &ldquo;same as if it was a
lady,&rdquo; said Alfred; and then he entered the coach, coachman
Charles cracked his whip over the four grays, and they were off to
the Hermitage landing on the river where the steamboat <i>Fairy</i>
awaited them. A stop was made at the wharf at Nashville for other
passengers, and then the <i>Fairy</i> swung out in the current of the
Cumberland and they were started on their way to Louisville, the
first leg of their journey to the capital.</p>
<p>A lady then resident in Nashville wrote of the departure:
&ldquo;When the old man finally started for Washington, a crowd of
ladies were assembled on the back piazza of the City Hotel, overlooking
the Cumberland River, to &lsquo;see the conquering hero <i>go</i>.&rsquo;
I mingled with them, and distinctly remember hearing one lady
say she had a good-bye kiss from the General and she would not
wash it off for a month. Oh! what a noise there was! A parrot,
which had been brought up a Democrat, was crying &lsquo;Hurrah for
Jackson;&rsquo; and the clapping, shouting and waving of handkerchiefs
have seldom been equaled. When the steamboat passed
out of sight and they realized that he was really gone, the city
seemed to subside and settle down as if the object of its being was
accomplished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Andrew Jackson went away to accept America&rsquo;s highest
honor. But no President-elect ever approached his inauguration
with less enthusiasm or with a heavier heart. Without his darling
Rachel by his side, it was an empty honor. Writing to John Coffee
a few weeks later he said: &ldquo;My days have been days of labor and
my nights have been nights of sorrow; but I look forward with
hope once more to return to the Hermitage and spend some days
near the tomb of my dear departed wife.&rdquo; And throughout the
eight years he spent in the White House, eight stormy years, his
memory kept stealing back to that spot in the Hermitage garden
where his heart lay buried by her side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>Thus closed one distinct era in the history of the Hermitage.
Without Rachel&rsquo;s presence the old house was never quite the same
again. When Jackson came back there to live in 1837 it was to a
new Hermitage, erected on the ruins of the one he had built for
Rachel in 1819; and although it was a larger and a finer house,
although he still entertained lavishly and took delight in the
presence in the house of his little grandchildren, he was merely
paying out the numbered days of his life, waiting to be laid at rest
beside that lonesome grave in the corner of the garden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">137</div>
<h2 id="c7">VII: GUESTS AT THE HERMITAGE</h2>
<p>Almost from the time it was built, the Hermitage held
an attraction for visitors from all over the country; and
since the death of General Jackson it has been a veritable
Mecca. To enumerate all of its distinguished visitors would
be to build up a bulky roster of the noted men of the past century;
but mention may be made in passing of some of the more prominent
people who have crossed the threshold of the Hermitage,
either to be greeted by its famous master during his lifetime or to
honor his memory since his old home has been established as a
national shrine.</p>
<p>Despite its relatively isolated location and its inaccessibility
during the early days, no less than eight Presidents of the United
States have been formally entertained there, not to mention those
who have visited it as an incident of a trip to Nashville. The
first Presidential guest was James Monroe, who visited Nashville
in June, 1819. This was before the present brick Hermitage was
built&mdash;probably just about the time it was started&mdash;and President
Monroe was perhaps the last famous guest to be entertained at the
old log Hermitage. Mr. Monroe&rsquo;s visit marked the first time that
a President of the United States had ever been entertained in
Nashville, and the proceedings were correspondingly elaborate.
The President had proceeded from Washington to Charleston,
South Carolina, and thence to Augusta, Georgia, and it was to the
latter city that General Jackson went to meet him and escort him
to the Hermitage. After spending two days there the party went
on to Nashville. A few miles out from the city they were met by
a committee of prominent citizens, with a company of soldiers,
by whom they were accompanied into town with no little flourish
and fanfare of trumpets. Upon arrival in Nashville a further
formal welcome was officially extended; there was a big dinner
at the old Nashville Inn, with a long list of patriotic toasts to be
drunk by the diners, and the next evening there was a great ball
in honor of the distinguished guest.</p>
<p>Other Presidents who have come to visit at the Jackson shrine
have been Martin Van Buren, Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan,
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
James K. Polk, Millard Fillmore, Rutherford B. Hayes, William
H. Taft, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt. The
visit of the earlier Roosevelt is particularly notable in the annals
of the Hermitage, because it was he who obtained from Congress
an appropriation of $5,000 to be devoted to the repair of the
old house.</p>
<p>When Mr. Hayes visited the old home of his distinguished
forerunner in the President&rsquo;s chair the ladies who accompanied
him were particularly careful to introduce him to old Uncle
Alfred. After the introduction was over, and Alfred had shaken
hands with Mr. Hayes, the ladies explained to the old servitor
that the white gentleman had held the same high office as General
Jackson. &ldquo;Well, if you&rsquo;d a been as great a man as he was,&rdquo; said
the candid old negro, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d a shuck your hand pretty near off!&rdquo;
President Taft on his subsequent visit to the Hermitage was told
this anecdote, and the old halls re&euml;choed with his characteristic
booming laughter.</p>
<p>Another man who bore the title of President and who was a
close friend of Jackson and a constant visitor at his home was not,
indeed, a President of the United States but the President of the
Republic of Texas&mdash;Sam Houston, the distinguished and eccentric
Tennesseean who mysteriously and suddenly resigned the
governorship and went to live with the Indians and then ended
his self-imposed exile and went to Texas to become that state&rsquo;s
most famous citizen.</p>
<p>Jackson was intensely interested in the annexation of Texas,
and when that was finally accomplished and Houston was elected
as the new state&rsquo;s first Senator, Old Hickory looked forward with
the keenest delight to the visit which Houston was planning to
pay him on his way from Texas to Washington. But when the
Texas hero reached Nashville he learned to his dismay that the
old statesman, long in precarious health, was that day literally on
his death bed; and although he hastened to the Hermitage with all
speed, he was just a few minutes too late to give a farewell clasp
of the hand to his old friend. Just before reaching the house he
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
met the carriage of Doctor Esselman on his way back to Nashville,
and the doctor conveyed to him the sad intelligence of the General&rsquo;s
death; so Houston, instead of going on to the Hermitage,
stopped by at Tulip Grove, but after the funeral he stayed over at
the Hermitage for a brief visit with the family. In her reminiscences
Mrs. Rachel Jackson Lawrence recalls this visit and how to
her childish mind the sober black clothing he then wore contrasted
so strongly with the brilliant military uniform in which
he was arrayed when he had visited the Hermitage a few years
before, soon after his history making victory over Santa Anna at
San Jacinto. Mrs. Lawrence also told of a visit Houston paid to the
Hermitage in 1836, when the work of rebuilding the house had
not quite been completed. At that time the flagstones of the front
portico had not yet been laid, and General Houston to the great
amusement of the children got down in the sand and loose dirt
and played &ldquo;Doodle bug, doodle bug, come out of your hole.&rdquo;
There was no pose of false dignity about Sam Houston&mdash;maybe
that was why so many people loved him.</p>
<p>The earliest distinguished visitor to the Hermitage&mdash;and the
one whose visit had the most far-reaching implications&mdash;was
Aaron Burr, the spectacular figure of the early nineteenth century
whose strange adventures almost embroiled General Jackson in
serious trouble.</p>
<p>Burr&rsquo;s first visit to the Nashville settlements, and to the Hermitage,
was in May, 1805. He had just stepped down from the
vice-presidency and his farewell speech to the Senate had been
greatly admired. His fatal duel with Alexander Hamilton, which
had stigmatized him in the East, did not detract any from his
popularity on the Tennessee frontier where killing a man in a
duel was not regarded as a matter involving any serious moral
turpitude. Upon his arrival in Nashville he was given a reception
that amounted to an ovation, culminating in a sumptuous dinner
with the usual round of toasts and speeches. Jackson rode in from
the Hermitage to take part in the festivities, attended by a servant
leading a milk-white horse; and when the dinner was over Colonel
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
Burr went back with him to the Hermitage as his guest. &ldquo;I have
been received with much hospitality and kindness, and could stay
a month with pleasure,&rdquo; Burr wrote his daughter, Theodosia.
From Nashville Colonel Burr went to New Orleans; but on his
return trip in August stopped at the Hermitage again for a visit of
eight days. To Theodosia he wrote: &ldquo;For a week I have been
lounging at the house of General Jackson&mdash;once a lawyer, after
a judge, now a planter; a man of intelligence, and one of those
prompt, frank, ardent souls whom I love to meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In September, 1806, Burr was back at the Hermitage, this time
with his mind apparently fully made up as to his contemplated
expedition to the Southwest. Theodosia he had brought along
with him as far as Blennerhassett Island on the Ohio where he had
left her; and in his frequent talks with the prominent citizens of
Nashville during his stay there he discussed freely his plans
to establish colonies &ldquo;on the western waters.&rdquo; There were not lacking
even then suspicious persons who wanted to know more about
the exact nature of the mysterious Colonel&rsquo;s mysterious plans; but
Jackson, at first at least, seemed to give full credence to Burr&rsquo;s
declarations of pacific intentions, and at the fete given in the
visitor&rsquo;s honor in Nashville he entered the ballroom accompanied
by Jackson attired in his full uniform as a major general.</p>
<p>This third visit lasted only a few days, Colonel Burr hastening
back to Kentucky; but in November Jackson, the merchant and
boat-builder, received from him an order for the building of five
large flatboats at his Clover Bottom boatyard and an accompanying
order for enough provisions from his Clover Bottom store to
stock them for their trip down the Mississippi. In the light of
subsequent events it might have seemed significant that such a
handsome piece of business was thrown in the lap of the frontier
celebrity who happened to be major-general of the militia as well
as a boat-builder and merchant, but if Burr counted on influencing
Jackson&rsquo;s judgment he reckoned without his man. Jackson, at the
time he accepted the order, must have been convinced of the law-abiding
nature of Burr&rsquo;s intentions. There was no secrecy about
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
their negotiations. But friends, not of so trusting a nature, were
insistent in urging him to watch his step; and so he wrote a candid
letter to Burr, telling him of the stories being circulated about his
alleged nefarious schemes, and asking him for the truth. He also
wrote to Governor Claiborne of the Orleans Territory, telling
him of the rumors, and to President Jefferson offering the services
of himself and his militia in the event of any trouble. Meanwhile
the work on the boats went right along. Burr had paid for them
in advance, and Jackson felt honor-bound to complete them despite
his growing suspicions; but he gave his partner, John Coffee,
strict instructions to accept no more business from Burr.</p>
<p>In December Burr came back to Nashville from Kentucky.
There the suspicions against his expedition had crystallized into
charges that led to his arrest; but Henry Clay defended him and
he was acquitted in triumph.</p>
<p>When Burr arrived at the Hermitage, for the fourth time, the
customary warm welcome was conspicuously lacking. Jackson
himself was not at home and Mrs. Jackson, so it is recorded, was
&ldquo;cool and constrained.&rdquo; Burr took lodgings at the tavern at Clover
Bottom; and when Jackson got home he immediately called on
the Colonel there, in company with General Overton, and frankly
told him of the rising tide of suspicion and distrust. Burr glibly
protested the innocence of his intentions; but it is significant that
he continued to lodge at the tavern and was not invited to stay at
the Hermitage. When General Jackson permitted a friend to stay
at a public house instead of insisting that he go home with him, it
is a strong indication that the General was beginning to smell a
mouse.</p>
<p>On December 22, 1806, Colonel Burr and a handful of adventurous
young men recruited in the neighborhood embarked in
the boats and pushed off from Clover Bottom. The denouement
came swiftly. Burr had hardly left Nashville before President
Jefferson&rsquo;s proclamation denouncing him and his expedition
reached town; and the populace which a few weeks before had
been entertaining him with balls and banquets now burnt him in
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
effigy. Jackson, as commander of the troops in this section, was
commanded by the Secretary of War to hold his forces in readiness
to march; and he entered fully into the spirit of his instructions
with a prompt display of energy and zeal. The militia was
assembled, warnings were sent down the river against &ldquo;all men
engaged in any enterprise contrary to the laws or orders of our
government;&rdquo; but, upon receipt of news from the government
forts down the river that the Burr flotilla had no warlike appearance,
the near-panic subsided.</p>
<p>Despite his alacrity in carrying out the orders of the President
and the Secretary of War, General Jackson clearly gave evidence
that he did not understand clearly what was going on. He was
obviously reluctant to suspect Burr of ulterior designs, and he
felt strongly that there was something sinister behind all the
furor. In the end, he himself was brought under suspicion and
was summoned as a witness in the trial in Richmond when Burr
was at length arrested and arraigned. Jackson never was put on
the witness stand; but he did take occasion, while he was waiting
in Richmond, to mount the courthouse steps and make a stump
speech in favor of Burr who, he had finally come to believe, was
being persecuted by Jefferson.</p>
<p>When he sat down and thought the matter over, Jackson doubtless
regretted deeply the day that the hospitality of the Hermitage
had been extended to the fascinating Burr.</p>
<p class="tb">A guest at the Hermitage whose visit demonstrated not only
Jackson&rsquo;s open-armed hospitality but also his winning way with
children was a young boy whose name later filled a large place in
history&mdash;Jefferson Davis.</p>
<p>In 1815 young Davis, then only seven years old, was sent from
his home in southwestern Mississippi to the St. Thomas School in
Washington County, Kentucky. This was at that time necessarily
an overland trip, there being no steamboats, and the way lay
through that part of Mississippi known as &ldquo;The wilderness&rdquo; before
the civilized part of Tennessee was reached. Travelers
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
through this Choctaw and Chickasaw country followed the
Natchez Trace and generally went in parties for safety and companionship.
Young Jefferson Davis accompanied a party headed
by his father&rsquo;s friend, Major Hinds who had participated in the
Battle of New Orleans, and Major Hinds&rsquo;s son, Howell, was also
a member of the party. The two boys were about the same age and,
mounted on their ponies, greatly enjoyed the long overland trip
up the romantic and dangerous Natchez Trace.</p>
<p>When the little cavalcade reached Nashville, the first thought
of Major Hinds was to visit his old commander, General Jackson,
under whom he had seen such stirring service just a few months
before. Accordingly, the whole party went trooping out to the
Hermitage, and there they were so cordially received that instead
of staying for a few days they remained several weeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Jackson&rsquo;s house at that time,&rdquo; wrote Mr. Davis in
later years, &ldquo;was a roomy log house. In front of it was a grove of
fine forest trees, and behind it were his cotton and grain fields. I
have never forgotten the unaffected and well-bred courtesy which
caused him to be remarked by court-trained diplomats when
President of the United States, by reason of his very impressive
bearing and manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Notwithstanding the many reports that have been made of his
profanity, I remember that he always said grace at his table, and
I never heard him utter an oath. In this connection although he
encouraged his adopted son, Howell Hinds and myself in all contests
of activity, pony-riding included, he would not allow us to
wrestle; for, he said, to allow hands to be put on one another
might lead to a fight. He was always very gentle and considerate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s education, like that of many excellent women
of her day, was deficient; but in all the hospitable and womanly
functions of wife and hostess she certainly was excelled by none.
A child is a keen observer of the characteristics of those under
whom he is placed, and I found Mrs. Jackson amiable, unselfish
and affectionate to her family and guests and just and mild toward
her servants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">144</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our stay with General Jackson was enlivened by the visits of
his neighbors, and we left the Hermitage with great regret and
pursued our journey. In me he inspired reverence and affection
that has remained with me through my whole life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This account of his memorable visit to the Hermitage was dictated
by Mr. Davis 75 years later, during the last year of his
life; and the fact that his visit as a child left on his mind such
a vivid impression is an eloquent tribute to the glowing personality
of Jackson and the kindly manner of his wife.</p>
<p class="tb">It was at the old log Hermitage that Jackson received the first
visit of Thomas H. Benton, the man who later became his close
friend and then his enemy and then his friend again. Young Benton
had been admitted to the Tennessee bar in 1804 and was practicing
in Franklin, a few miles from Nashville. In 1805 he had a
land title case in which were involved some legal points upon
which Andrew Jackson had ruled while he was sitting on the
Superior Court. These rulings had not been published, however,
and so Benton saddled his horse and rode to the Hermitage to
ask the ex-justice for an official report of the cases. Upon learning
his errand, Jackson courteously offered to write out the opinions
for him; so, with Jackson dictating and Benton transcribing, the
opinion of the Superior Court was thus tardily reduced to written
form. It was typical of the hospitality of the Hermitage that
Benton, who had made an instantaneously good impression on
Jackson, was prevailed upon to prolong his formal call to a two-days&rsquo;
visit; and there was the beginning of a friendship which had
a lasting and far-reaching effect upon the careers of both of them.
For many years Benton was a frequenter of the Hermitage to
such an extent as almost to be regarded as a member of the family;
and, despite an intervening period of enmity growing out of a
bloody, knock-down-and-drag-out fight, Benton&rsquo;s eulogy of Jackson
when he died showed the depth of his affection for the older
man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>A visitor of world-wide distinction who was a guest at the
Hermitage was the celebrated Marquis de Lafayette. General
Jackson had long been an admirer of the patriotic Marquis. Mrs.
Jackson herself is authority for the statement that Jackson first
saw him at Charleston &ldquo;on the battlefield&rdquo; when he was a boy of
twelve and the Marquis was at the zenith of his great Revolutionary
popularity. When Jackson was in Washington in the latter
part of 1824 as a Senator he met Lafayette, in fact lived at the
same tavern with him while he was there, and it was probably at
that time that the Marquis was invited to visit Nashville and the
Hermitage. He had previously written Jackson, soon after his arrival
in this country, saying &ldquo;I will not leave the United States before
I have seeked and found the opportunity to express in person
my high regard and sincere friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Marquis and his party steamed up to the wharf in Nashville
on May 4, 1825, and were there greeted tumultuously by the
Nashville populace, General Jackson foremost among them. The
enthusiastic Nashvillians had prepared a rather elaborate entertainment
for the celebrated French nobleman, including a big
parade and a formal call on Governor Carroll. The next morning
the Marquis reviewed the Tennessee militia (which had been encamped
at Nashville a week patiently awaiting his belated arrival)
and after the review the party boarded the steamboat again
and proceeded up the river to the Hermitage to have dinner with
General Jackson. Dinner in those days was a big meal served at
about three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a record of this visit is preserved in a book written
by M. LeVasseur, Lafayette&rsquo;s secretary, who, after telling of the
entertainment in Nashville, says: &ldquo;At one o&rsquo;clock we embarked,
with a numerous company, to proceed to dine with General Jackson,
whose residence is a few miles up the river. We there found
numbers of ladies and farmers from the neighborhood whom
Mrs. Jackson had invited to partake of the entertainment she had
prepared for General Lafayette. The first thing that struck me on
arriving at the General&rsquo;s was the extreme simplicity of his house.
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
Still somewhat influenced by my European habits, I asked myself
if this could really be the dwelling of the most popular man in
the United States, of him whom the country proclaimed one of her
most illustrious defenders; of him, finally, who by the will of the
people was on the point of becoming her Chief Magistrate. One
of our fellow-passengers, a citizen of Nashville, witnessing my
astonishment, asked me whether in France our public men, that is
to say the servants of the people, lived very differently from other
citizens. &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;thus, for example, the majority of
our generals, all our ministers, and even the greater part of our
subaltern administrators, would think themselves dishonored and
would not dare to receive anyone at their houses if they possessed
such a residence as this of Jackson&rsquo;s; and the modest dwellings of
your illustrious chiefs of the Revolution&mdash;Washington, John
Adams, Jefferson&mdash;would only inspire them with contempt and
disgust.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having thus tactfully ingratiated himself with the party, M.
LeVasseur accompanied the other guests on a visit of inspection
to the farm and garden, and then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On returning to the house, some friends of General Jackson
who probably had not seen him for some time, begged him to
show them the arms presented to him in honor of his achievements
during the last war; he acceded to their request with great
politeness and placed on a table a sword, a saber and a pair of
pistols. The sword was presented to him by Congress; the saber, I
believe, by the army which fought under his command at New
Orleans. These two weapons, of American manufacture, were remarkable
for their finish and still more so for the honorable inscriptions
with which they were covered. But it was to the pistols
that General Jackson wished more particularly to call our attention.
He handed them to General Lafayette and asked him if
he recognized them. The latter, after examining them attentively
for a few minutes, replied that he fully recollected them to be a
pair he had presented in 1778 to his paternal friend, Washington,
and that he experienced a real satisfaction in finding them in the
hands of one so worthy of possessing them. At these words the
face of &lsquo;Old Hickory&rsquo; was covered with a modest blush, and his
eye sparkled as in a day of victory. &lsquo;Yes, I believe myself worthy
of them,&rsquo; exclaimed he, in pressing the pistols on Lafayette&rsquo;s
hands to his breast, &lsquo;if not from what I have done, at least for what
I wished to do for my country.&rsquo; All of the bystanders applauded
this noble confidence of the patriot hero, and were convinced that
the weapons of Washington could not be in better hands than
those of Jackson.&rdquo; (These pistols, it should be here interpolated,
were presented to General Jackson by General George Washington&rsquo;s
nephew, Bushrod Washington; and were a part of the
valued collection of trophies in the Hermitage until they were lost
in the fire in 1834.)</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
<p>Lafayette&rsquo;s stay at the Hermitage was short. In the late afternoon
his steamboat returned to Nashville where a grand banquet
was given in his honor that evening, with General Jackson presiding.
The Marquis left the next morning by steamboat for
Louisville, and had a narrow escape from death when the boat
struck a snag in the Ohio and sank within a few minutes. Fortunately,
however, he escaped without injury.</p>
<p>Another distinguished visitor from France in the early days
was the elder Michaux, the great naturalist, who tells in his
journal how he &ldquo;spent the night twelve miles from Nashville at
the home of a Mr. Jackson.&rdquo; Michaux, however, with his naturalist&rsquo;s
heart, was much less impressed by the reputation, then hardly
more than local, of General Jackson than he was by the beauty of
the yellow-wood trees he found &ldquo;on land belonging to a Mr.
Overton south of Nashville&rdquo; in greater abundance than he had
ever noticed the trees elsewhere. He sent home some seeds from
these trees found on Judge Overton&rsquo;s hills, and in two of the parks
of Paris today may be seen specimens of this rather rare tree grown
from the seeds sent from Nashville by this early visitor.</p>
<p>Still another celebrated Frenchman visited the Hermitage in
1843 and paid his respects to the old hero&mdash;Marshall Bertrand,
one of Napoleon&rsquo;s famous marshals, who came to Nashville in
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
the course of his travels in America and, as a matter of course, was
entertained at dinner by Jackson, despite his debilitated health.</p>
<p class="tb">Perhaps the greatest strain ever placed upon the hospitality of
the old house was when it was visited in August, 1830, by Major
John H. Eaton and his bride, the erstwhile Peggy O&rsquo;Neal, the
storm center of the early days of the Jackson administration. This
was a visit that required no little stage managing and window
dressing; for the vivid Mrs. Eaton had not only disrupted the
President&rsquo;s Cabinet, she had brought discord into his own family;
and it was in the midst of the strained relations existing between
Jackson and the Donelsons that the Eatons made their visit to
Tennessee.</p>
<p>Jackson was spending the summer of 1830 at home, and he was
determined that the Eatons should be formally entertained at the
Hermitage and that his connections, as he called Major Donelson
and his wife, should assist in the reception. Here was a situation
that called for all the keenest diplomacy of the most astute members
of the Kitchen Cabinet; but the old reliable John Coffee,
himself one of the &ldquo;connections,&rdquo; exercised his powers of persuasion
on the Donelsons and at length it was arranged that they
would help Old Hickory entertain his celebrated but slightly
tarnished guests. Gleefully Jackson wrote to Eaton in August
when Coffee had finished with his wire-pulling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Private and for your own eye.</p>
<p>My dear Major: I send my son to meet you at Judge Overton&rsquo;s and to
conduct you and your lady with our other friends to the Hermitage,
where you will receive that heartfelt welcome that you were ever wont
to receive when my dear departed wife was living. Her absence makes
everything here wear to me a gloomy and melancholy aspect, but the
presence of her old and sincere friend will cheer me amidst the melancholy
gloom with which I am surrounded.</p>
<p>My neighbors and connections will receive you and your lady with
that good feeling that is due to you, and I request you and your lady
will meet them with your usual courtesy, which is so well calculated to
gain universal applause even from enemies and the united approbation
of all friends. Our enemies calculate much upon injuring me by raising
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
the cry that I forced Mr. A. J. Donelson from me and compelled him to
retire because he would not yield to my views, which they call improper.
I mean to be able to shew that I only claimed to rule my household, that
it should extend justice and common politeness to all and no more, and
thus put my enemies in the wrong; and if any friends desert me, then it
is theirs not my fault.</p>
<p>General Coffee has, since here, produced a visible and sensible change
in my connections and they will all be here to receive you and your lady
who I trust will receive them with her usual courtesy and if a perfect
reconciliation can not take place that harmony may prevail and a link
broken in the Nashville conspiracy. I trust you are aware that I will
never abandon you or separate from you so long as you continue to
practice those virtues that have always accompanied you, nor would I
ask you or your friend to pursue a course to compromise or be degrading
to themselves or feelings; but I am anxious that we pursue such a course
as will break down the Nashville combination, which I view as the
sprouts of the Washington conspiracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Under these more or less auspicious circumstances the Eatons
came to the Hermitage, where nothing was left undone to make
them feel that they were just as welcome as any other guest that
ever crossed the threshold of the old house. The Donelsons were
there, taking part in the reception of the guests, Mrs. Donelson
the very essence of punctilious and cordial hospitality&mdash;although
she probably had her enthusiasm well under control. Pretty
Peggy Eaton was no fool; she must have known of the cajoling it
had required to prepare the way for her reception at the Hermitage;
and, although she was spiteful enough to relish the concealed
discomfiture of the Donelsons, it was probably a relief to
her and to everybody else (except perhaps Old Hickory himself)
when the party was over and the Eatons had to go.</p>
<p>Mrs. Eaton in her old age sat down and wrote a rambling sort
of autobiography, in the course of which she told of this visit to
the Hermitage&mdash;although nowhere in her reminiscences does she
mention the Donelsons, whom she so cordially hated. The dinner
at the Hermitage in her honor, she relates, was a splendid occasion,
with the General doing the honors with great gusto and
making jokes with the guests over the carving of a barbecued
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
pig which was one of the features of the dinner. The General also
distinguished himself as a host by passing the bread himself,
which was his way of making everybody feel at home. After dinner,
however, the master of the Hermitage disappeared; and then
it was that Mrs. Eaton, sent by her husband to look for him,
found him kneeling by Rachel&rsquo;s grave in the garden with the
tears streaming down his face. Recalling to him his duties as a
host she persuaded him to return to the house, where he again
donned his mask of gaiety and entered into the hilarity of the
guests assembled there.</p>
<p>Writing of the Presidential campaign of 1824, Parton says:
&ldquo;The Hermitage was more like a hotel than a home during the
summer, so numerous were the guests whom curiosity, friendship
or political business brought to it.&rdquo; And an old lady in Nashville
told Parton that she had often been at the Hermitage in those
simple old times when there was in each of the four available
rooms not merely a guest but a family, while the young men and
solitary travelers who chanced to drop in disposed of themselves
on the piazza or any other half-shelter about the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never was the Hermitage without a guest,&rdquo; says Buell in his
Jackson biography, &ldquo;and most of the time it was crowded. Jackson
and his wife carried the old-fashioned Southern hospitality to
an extreme. They did not wish their guests to be simply visitors,
but made them temporary members of the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seems to be the unanimous and unchallenged opinion that a
visitor at the Hermitage was always made to feel at home and led
to believe that his visit conferred an especial pleasure on his hosts.
All comers were welcome.</p>
<p>But Andrew Jackson did not wait for guests to come to the
Hermitage. Nor were its broad doors open only to the distinguished
and prosperous. A characteristic incident is told by
one of his early acquaintances relative to the son of the famous
Daniel Boone: &ldquo;The young man had come to Nashville on his
father&rsquo;s business, to be detained some weeks, and had his lodgings
at a small tavern towards the lower part of town. General Jackson
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
heard of it; sought him out; found him; took him home to remain
as long as his business detained him in the country, saying: &lsquo;Your
father&rsquo;s dog should not stay in a tavern while I have a house.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hospitality of the Hermitage not only knew no limitation
on the grounds of a visitor&rsquo;s prosperity or prominence, it was extended
alike to friend and foe.</p>
<p>A son of the notorious William G. (Parson) Brownlow, a
rabid Whig and bitter anti-Jackson man, relates that on one occasion
in 1845 a party of East Tennessee Whigs who had been attending
a convention in Nashville and were on their way home
decided to stop at the Hermitage and pay their respects to the
ex-President. Parson Brownlow was one of the party, and when they
reached the gate he expressed some doubt as to the propriety of
his entering the home of the man whom he had so vigorously and
consistently denounced, but he was prevailed upon to go along
with his friends. He insisted, however, that when they got inside
the house he would remain in the background so as to avoid the
necessity of having his name called in the general introductions.
But Jackson always knew what was going on about him, and he
immediately noticed that there was one of the party who had not
been introduced, whereupon Brownlow was presented. &ldquo;I have
heard of you before,&rdquo; the old General said with dry wit; but he
shook his hand cordially and treated him with particular courtesy
during the remainder of the call, never giving any sign that one
of his guests was a man who had waged bitter warfare on him
during his days of political activity.</p>
<p>Another similar example was afforded by the visit of Mr.
Leslie Combs, a former member of Congress from Kentucky, who
came to the Hermitage as a messenger from one of the sons of
General Isaac Shelby, bearing a letter relating to a controversy
that had sprung up between the Shelbys and Jackson. Mr. Combs
arrived at the Hermitage just before dinner time, was received
with the greatest courtesy, invited into the dining room to join
the family at dinner, and urged to stay at the house as a guest.
When he left Old Hickory himself put some apples in his saddle-bags&mdash;but,
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
at the same time, he made an appointment with him
to meet him at a certain hotel in Nashville, the next day, and
when the appointment was kept General Jackson proceeded to
denounce Mr. Combs for acting as his enemies&rsquo; messenger, and
wound up by indulging himself in his favorite pastime of denouncing
Henry Clay. As long as Mr. Combs was a guest at the
Hermitage, Old Hickory&rsquo;s code demanded that he be treated with
punctilious politeness; but, on neutral ground, he wanted Mr.
Combs to know exactly how he felt.</p>
<p>Stephen A. Douglas is now remembered in history principally
on account of the series of political debates preceding his victorious
contest with Abraham Lincoln for a seat in the United States
Senate; but he also is recalled by Jacksonian students as the
man who delivered the leading speech in the House of Representatives
in 1834 on the resolution to refund the fine paid by General
Jackson under the order of Judge Hall in New Orleans following
his declaration of martial law there after his victory over
Pakenham. Some time after the passage of this resolution there
was a political convention in Nashville and the delegates visited
the Hermitage to pay their respects to the venerable ex-President.
When Judge Douglas was presented to Jackson, according to an
account of the episode in <i>Harper&rsquo;s Weekly</i> in 1857, the old General
exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the Mr. Douglas who delivered a speech in Congress
showing that I did not violate the Constitution at New Orleans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did deliver a speech on that subject,&rdquo; modestly replied Mr.
Douglas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then sit down here beside me,&rdquo; said General Jackson with
enthusiasm, &ldquo;I desire to return you my thanks for that speech.
You are the first man I know who has done me justice. You have
relieved my mind from a weight that has lain upon it for thirty
years. Let me thank you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The account concludes: &ldquo;Senator Douglas&rsquo;s heart was too full
to speak. He pressed the veteran&rsquo;s hand, and withdrew from the
room to conceal his emotions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>In a diary kept by an old resident of Nashville, Mr. James M.
Hamilton, there is displayed an evidence of the cordiality of the
master of the Hermitage in receiving the kind of a visitor who
generally is not a very welcome guest to the most hospitable of
hosts.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamilton was a youth, working in a store in Nashville, and
after General Jackson&rsquo;s return from Washington in 1837 he was
sent out to the Hermitage to collect an account amounting to more
than $3,000 which Andrew, junior, had run up while the General
was President. Mr. Hamilton had been brought up a Clay Whig,
and he was admittedly terrified at the prospect of bearding the
fire-eating General Jackson in his den and trying to collect a bill.
But he swallowed his fears, mounted his horse and rode out to the
Hermitage, entered the General&rsquo;s office and proffered the bill to
him. Colonel A. S. Colyar, in his <i>Life and Times of Andrew
Jackson</i> quotes from the Hamilton diary:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let me see it, my son,&rsquo; said the General; and he reached forth
his long slender hand. As his eyes rested on item after item, I
eagerly watched the expression of his countenance. No frown of
displeasure was there, but simply attention. Folding the paper, he
slowly said: &lsquo;This is a large bill. My son Andrew is a good man,
but a very extravagant one. I see many things here he could have
done without. But, my son, I will pay this bill on one condition.
It is that your employers will correct mistakes, should there be
any.&rsquo; I assured him that they would certainly do so, and he requested
me to write a check on the Planters&rsquo; Bank, adding: &lsquo;My
son, I came home from Washington with but 75 cents of my salary
left, and had it not been for the kindness of my friend, Francis
Blair, in lending me money, I would not be able to meet these obligations.&rsquo;
I had never written a check and had no form with me,
but I did the best I could and he signed it. He then requested me
to write a receipt. Again I was puzzled, but I did the best I could
and he accepted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arose to go. He invited me most cordially to remain to dinner.
I was too much delighted, too happy, too much relieved to
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
think of such a thing. I longed to get back to the store and show
them my check and tell them of my success. I felt a wild, boyish
admiration for the great man before me, and I wondered how anyone
could be so wicked as to say aught disagreeable of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you will not stay, then you must see something of the Hermitage,&rsquo;
he said, leading the way. I walked beside him about the
grounds, the feeling of admiration and enthusiasm all the while
in my heart for the great, tender-souled man whose guest I was.
As we neared the tomb he raised his hand and, pointing, said:
&lsquo;My son, there lies the best woman that ever lived.&rsquo; A cloud of
sadness spread over his face, and the expression was in keeping
with the crepe on his hat&mdash;that crepe was worn the rest of his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;George,&rsquo; he called, &lsquo;show Mr. Hamilton around and I will
await him here.&rsquo; I was shown the old gray warhorse, well cared
for in his stable&mdash;the steed hero of the battle of New Orleans&mdash;and
also the carriage which was made from the timbers of the
ship <i>Constitution</i>, and in which General Jackson rode at the side
of Mr. Van Buren from the White House to the east wing of the
Capitol on the occasion of the inauguration of the latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Returning, I found the ex-President awaiting me at the door.
As I took leave he warmly pressed my hand and invited me to
visit him, saying that my short stay under his roof had given him
a great deal of pleasure, that when he came to the city he would
be very much gratified if I would seek him out and speak to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Jackson&rsquo;s circumstances then a visitor seeking payment of a
$3,000 account must have been about as unwelcome a guest as
could well be imagined; but the affable manner in which he received
that timid youth, shrinking from an unpleasant duty,
showed the manner of man he was&mdash;and perhaps gives us a clue
to the reason for the ardent admiration of his friends.</p>
<p class="tb">Long before the Hermitage was formally opened to the public
as a national shrine, visitors to Nashville, despite the difficulties
involved, were in the habit of making the pilgrimage to Jackson&rsquo;s
old home to see the house where he had lived and to stand by his
tomb.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">155</div>
<p>An interesting bit of human interest material is to be found in
the visit, on the last day of March in 1851, of none other than
the celebrated Mr. Phineas T. Barnum, accompanied by his current
prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Jenny Lind. This was while Mr. Barnum was conducting
the Swedish Nightingale on her history-making tour
through the United States, during the course of which two concerts
were given in Nashville. While there the immortal songstress,
accompanied by Mr. Barnum, and his daughter, engaged a
carriage and drove out the dusty road to the Hermitage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On that occasion,&rdquo; relates Mr. Barnum in his reminiscences,
&ldquo;for the first time that season, we heard the wild mocking-bird
singing in the trees. This gave Jenny Lind great delight, as she
had never before heard them sing except in their wire-bound
cages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is all that Mr. Barnum says in his book about this incident,
pregnant with beauty and romance. The Nightingale&rsquo;s first encounter
with her only rival, the Southern mocking-bird! What a
subject there for a man with a poet&rsquo;s imagination! But Mr. Barnum
hurries on in his book to tell in great detail of an elaborate
series of practical jokes he staged the next day&mdash;April Fool&rsquo;s Day.
But it is fascinating to let the mind play with the idea of the great
Swedish singer standing there entranced that spring day beneath
the hollies and cedars and magnolias of Old Hickory&rsquo;s lawn, listening
to the sad, sweet music of the native songbird. What
wouldn&rsquo;t history give for a motion picture, with sound effects, of
that dramatic little episode on the Hermitage lawn touched on
so briefly in his book by the voluble Mr. Barnum?</p>
<p>This, by the way, was not Barnum&rsquo;s first visit to the Hermitage.
Early in 1838, while touring the South with a tented theatrical
company, he relates that &ldquo;We exhibited at Nashville (where I
visited General Jackson at the Hermitage).&rdquo; How tantalizingly
economical with words is the old showman! How entertaining
and enlightening it would be to know more about the visit of
Barnum to Jackson! Barnum admitted that he was a master of
humbuggery; some of Old Hickory&rsquo;s opponents charged that he
<span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
was a skilled practitioner of the same art. Did they admire each
other? Why didn&rsquo;t Barnum tell us more about his visits to the
Hermitage?</p>
<p class="tb">On a hot July day in 1862 there clattered up the driveway of
the Hermitage a distinguished and unexpected group of visitors&mdash;General
Nathan Bedford Forrest and his men. This was before
the guard of Federal troops was stationed at the old house;
in fact, Nashville had only recently been surrendered by the Confederates
and Forrest was making it his business to harass the
city&rsquo;s outposts to such an extent that the army of occupation was
not yet entirely sure that it could hold the city.</p>
<p>On this occasion Forrest had just made a foray into Lebanon
and was moving with his men down the Lebanon Road towards
Nashville with the idea of seeing how close he could get to the
city before stirring up a nest of bluecoats. But the Hermitage
could not be passed by by any native Tennesseean, even General
Forrest, without a visit; and so the famous &ldquo;Wizard of the Saddle&rdquo;
and his lusty young troopers turned aside from the dusty
road for a brief respite from their business of making war and to
pay a tribute to Tennessee&rsquo;s noblest warrior of all.</p>
<p>The day of Forrest&rsquo;s visit happened to be the first anniversary
of the First Battle of Manassas, the famous defeat of the Federals
known by them as the Battle of Bull Run; and the ladies of the
Hermitage neighborhood had gathered there for a picnic and
celebration. The sudden appearance of the idolized Forrest and
his men added just what was needed to make the affair a stupendous
success; and the Confederate calvarymen partook of the
picnic dinner under the trees, walked the garden paths with the
young ladies and wandered through the halls of Old Hickory&rsquo;s
old home like typical sight-seers, temporarily oblivious of the
fact that a detachment of Yankees was hot on their trail.</p>
<p class="tb">When the occasion demanded it, the hospitality of the Hermitage
could function on a wholesale, large scale basis. For instance,
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
when a regiment of Texas volunteers paid a visit of respect
to General Jackson just before his death they did not go
away without entertainment or without refreshment. Only a day
before their visit did Jackson learn of their impending descent
on him and immediately all the plantation&rsquo;s facilities were directed
to the preparations for the visitors. Sheep, beeves and
chickens were killed in large quantities, and every fireplace on
the plantation was filled to capacity with meats of every description.
A wagon was sent to Nashville and brought back a wagonload
of bread, for the Hermitage&rsquo;s ovens couldn&rsquo;t bake that much
bread on such short notice; and when the 900 Texans marched
up the driveway the next morning everything was ready for them.
The officers were entertained in the dining room while the rank
and file were fed, picnic fashion, on the lawn. This occasion was
enlivened, during the course of the proceedings, by the chance
discovery by Aunt Hannah of one of the camp followers of the
regiment making off with two of the Hermitage&rsquo;s handsome silver
pitchers. Cries of &ldquo;Stop, thief! Stop, thief!&rdquo; by the faithful old
servant quickly attracted the attention of the soldier guests, the
thief was promptly apprehended and the pitchers recovered. And
while the soldiers were receiving Old Hickory&rsquo;s congratulations
for recovering his highly prized pitchers the thief quietly walked
off in the confusion and thus escaped punishment.</p>
<p class="tb">Was there ever such a house for hospitality? Peddlers and
Presidents, rich men and poor men, famous men and obscure
youths, individuals and regiments of soldiers&mdash;all looked alike
to the Hermitage. Is it any wonder that it was famous, far and
wide, as a place where everybody&mdash;friend or foe&mdash;was always
welcome?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<h2 id="c8">VIII: THE TENNESSEE FARMER</h2>
<p>Andrew Jackson is known to fame as a statesman and
as a military leader who triumphed over the savage Indians
and the trained British troops of Pakenham; but
primarily Andrew Jackson was a farmer, a man whose livelihood
depended on the outcome of his crops and whose prosperity waxed
and waned with the fluctuations of the New Orleans cotton market.</p>
<p>After all, it should be remembered, Jackson&rsquo;s active military
career was concentrated in the eight years between 1813 and 1821,
and his service as President extended only from 1829 to 1837; but
he was a farmer and stock-breeder from the time he bought the
Poplar Flat plantation in 1792 until he died at the Hermitage
in 1845. Nothing ever gave him such pleasure as to walk about
his farm with some visitor and show his growing crops, his stables
and barns. The last day he was on his feet before his death he
insisted, despite his enfeebled condition, on walking several hundred
yards with a visiting friend to show him how well his cotton
was doing.</p>
<p>During the eight years he was serving as a soldier he was away
from home a large part of the time; but his wife was living then,
and all authorities agree that she was thoroughly capable of managing
the plantation and doing it well. Mrs. Jackson was not only
a good housewife and a genial host, she was really a capable
executive&mdash;and managing a big plantation in those days required
genuine executive ability, for an establishment like the Hermitage
was in reality an almost entirely self-contained little principality,
capable of sustaining its owners and the slaves who supplied
the labor. Not only did the plantation provide all the foodstuffs
consumed, with the exception of sugar and coffee; but the
slaves made practically everything used on the place. Wool gathered
from the flock of 100 sheep was woven by the old slave
women into bolts of cloth fifty yards in length, the weavers averaging
about five yards a day. A tannery supplied leather for the
shoes, there was a grist mill for grinding the wheat and corn
into flour and meal, there was a blacksmith shop, a cotton gin, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
syrup mill, etc. The family, of course, bought clothing in Nashville,
or in Philadelphia or Washington; but clothing and shoes
for the slaves were made on the place by the slave seamstresses
and cobblers and about the only article of wearing apparel that
had to be bought for them was hats.</p>
<p>Managing an institution of this kind was no child&rsquo;s play; but
Mrs. Jackson had come to the Cumberland country with the original
settlers and she possessed the indomitable, self-reliant spirit
of the pioneer. She, to be sure, had the assistance of an overseer;
but overseers were for the most part a shifty and unreliable lot,
and in those days while Jackson was away fighting the Indians
and the redcoats the real managerial ability had to rest on her.
It is not recorded anywhere that Mrs. Jackson felt it at all out of
the ordinary that she should take charge of the plantation in the
General&rsquo;s absence; and in none of her letters to him did she complain
of the responsibilities resting on her shoulders. The General
had written her quite candidly while at Fort Strother in January,
1814, in the midst of the campaign against the Creeks: &ldquo;On
the subject of my private and domestic concerns, you and Col.
Hays and Mr. John Hutchings must regulate it. I have not time
to spend many thoughts upon worldly pelf or gear. My station
is arduous and my duty severe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of this frank admonition, however, even as he rested
before New Orleans on the eve of the battle there that was to
make him a figure of world-wide fame, General Jackson had
obtruded on him there some of the vexing problems of plantation
management&mdash;not, it should be noted, by the self-contained Rachel
but by her sister&rsquo;s husband, Colonel Robert Hays, mentioned in
Jackson&rsquo;s letter. Colonel Hays, probably with good intentions but
certainly with an atrocious lack of good sense, sat down and wrote
him a tediously detailed letter to tell him about all the trouble
being experienced in getting a good overseer and the demoralization
of the slaves growing out of the inefficient overseer&rsquo;s lack
of capacity. &ldquo;They did not tread out thirty bushels of oats in
three days,&rdquo; wrote Mr. Hayes of the trifling slaves; and then went
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
on to relate the harrowing experience of one of them who was
sent to Nashville on an errand, was waylaid on his return and
came home with &ldquo;a large load of small shot in his back which is
still in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was there ever in the history of the world another General
commanding his nation&rsquo;s troops on the eve of a decisive battle
who had to drop his studies of tactical problems in order to consider
the case of an overseer back home who &ldquo;is a good honest
man, but drinks too hard&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Most of the time, however, General Jackson was at home to
manage things for himself, and everybody agreed that when it
came to running a farm and raising blooded stock he know what
he was about. In 1824 the Hermitage was visited by Willie Blount,
former governor of Tennessee, and in a letter written concerning
this visit Governor Blount said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although I have ever considered him to be among the most
industrious men of my acquaintance, both in public and private
life, I was really surprised to find his farm in such excellent order
and so very productive, under all the circumstances relating to his
great absence from home attending the public relations during
the late war and since. His farming land is, as you know, very
fertile, very beautiful, and eligibly situated for comfort. It is
largely improved, handsomely arranged with gratifying appearance
to the visitors at his most hospitable house, open to all who
have the pleasure of his acquaintance and who travel through
his neighborhood, none of whom pass that way without calling
on him for social intercourse, viewing him to be the polite gentleman
at home and abroad and the friend of man everywhere.
His very arrangement for farming on an extensive scale delights
the man of observation; his fields are extensive and nicely cultivated
as a garden; his meadows and pastures are extensive and
neatly kept; his stock of horses, cattle, sheep and hogs are of the
best kind and all in excellent order; his domestics and hirelings
are all contented and comfortably provided for, and their daily
labor is a pleasure to them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>When Lafayette visited the Hermitage his secretary, though
frankly disappointed at the simplicity of the house itself, commented
favorably on the appearance of the garden and farm.
&ldquo;We everywhere remarked the greatest order and most perfect
neatness,&rdquo; he wrote in his journal, &ldquo;and we might have believed
ourselves on the property of one of the richest and most skilful
of the German farmers if, at every step, our eyes had not been
afflicted by the sad spectacle of slavery.&rdquo; To ameliorate his reference
to the &ldquo;peculiar institution,&rdquo; however, the visiting Frenchman
was careful to add that &ldquo;Everybody told us that General
Jackson&rsquo;s slaves were treated with the greatest humanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * *</span></p>
<p>One of the greatest problems encountered by Jackson in the
management of the Hermitage plantation, and one that he never
solved to his entire satisfaction, was that of obtaining the services
of a thoroughly competent and industrious overseer. His correspondence
is studded with letters complaining of their manifold
shortcomings; and there was a steadily changing stream of men
occupying this important and trying post.</p>
<p>When the General returned from his brief residence in Florida,
he took hold of things at once, and one of the first things he did
was to look for a new overseer. Alex Barksdale was hired at the
beginning of the year 1823, and some idea of the limited agricultural
equipment of even a big farm in the early days may be
had from the following memorandum receipt for tools, stock, etc.,
which Barksdale gave Jackson under date of January 8, 1823:</p>
<p>&ldquo;1 dagon plough, 5 single ploughs, 2 double ploughs, 1 colter
plough, 3 pair of stretchers, 1 half-inch augur, 1 two-inch augur,
1 five-quarter augur, 1 chissel, 1 crosscut saw, 3 scythe and cradle,
1 stone augur, 1 augur and wheel, 1 rammer, 3 clevises, 1 two-foot
rule, 1 foot adze, 7 singletrees, 6 pair of hames, 10 axes, 2
mattocks, 9 hoes, 1 plough hoe, 5 pair of traces, 1 handsaw, 1 crow-bar,
1 sledge hammer, 1 hand hammer, 1 pair of wedges, 1 mortising
axe, 1 drawing knife, 2 pair lock chains. Horned cattle:
39 head grown and four oxen, 23 calves; 63 head grown sheep;
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
115 head of hogs. Received January 8th from Andrew Jackson
as his overseer, to be carefully kept and superintended as such,
the within farming utensils and above stock and plantation tools.
(signed) <span class="sc">Alex Barksdale</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barksdale came well recommended, but did not finish out the
year, being succeeded by Benjamin B. Person. Person filled the
job until the end of 1824, then he too passed on to make way for
another new one.</p>
<p>All this constant change in overseers was bad enough as long
as the General and Mrs. Jackson were able to give their personal
supervision to what was going on; but when Jackson left the Hermitage
early in 1829 to be inaugurated President, closely following
Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s death in December, 1828, it was necessary to
engage a thoroughly reliable man in whose charge to place the
whole establishment. Andrew Jackson Donelson, who owned the
adjoining plantation, was going along with Jackson as his private
secretary; and so the two of them entered into a formal, written
contract with one Graves W. Steele. This is an interesting document,
as showing the conditions under which such arrangements
were made at that time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This memorandum of agreement between Andrew Jackson and Andrew
J. Donelson of the one part and Graves Steele of the other part,
both of the county of Davidson and State of Tennessee, Witnesseth,
that the said Andrew Jackson and Andrew J. Donelson have employed
the said Steele to oversee their negroes and manage the affairs of their
plantations during the year 1829, and as such have placed him in possession
of the working tools, the horses and stock of every description,
and whatsoever else appertains to the land as necessary to its cultivation
and protection, with obligations to bestow upon them the attention and
care usually expected from the most faithful, diligent and industrious
overseers. And further the said Steele is left in charge of their dwelling
houses and the buildings attached to them, and is obligated to devote
to them the care necessary to their preservation, and the furniture within
them; and to do whatever else the said Andrew Jackson and Andrew
J. Donelson may point out relating to the correct disposition and management
of their interests on their plantations. And in consideration
of these services the said Andrew Jackson and Andrew J. Donelson are
obligated to pay to the said Graves Steele at the end of the year the just
and lawful sum of six hundred dollars.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>Within six months Jackson was writing to his adopted son expressing
apprehension lest Steele was not giving the negroes
proper attention; and before the year was out was again writing
to the son at Nashville to investigate the cause for &ldquo;the great loss
of horses and oxen.&rdquo; Evidently conditions did not improve, for
in November the General wrote a sharp letter to Steele in which
he took him severely to task for &ldquo;the great losses in stock and
negroes I have lost since I left my plantation under your charge
and management.&rdquo; In blunt terms he said: &ldquo;I have been truly
astonished to hear my bacon was nearly gone. This to me was
unaccountable, because I stood by and saw a large supply as usual
for my white and black family salted in my smoke house. In your
statement I have asked you to forward I shall expect you to furnish
me with an explanation of how this happened. I have been
advised by some not to continue you, by others to try you another
year. The latter I have concluded to do so, as I am aware the
injury it would be to you to leave the business under present
rumors. But when I say I have concluded to retain you another
year, it is with the express condition that you treat my negroes with
humanity and attention when sick and not work them too hard
when well, that you feed and clothe them well, and that you carefully
attend to my stock of all kinds. This I have a right to expect
of you for the wages I give you. I have been offered here a first-rate
overseer for $350 a year. I have been offered in Tennessee a
well experienced and well recommended overseer for $400. I
give you $500, which is equal to $1000 when cotton was at 14
cents a pound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steele evidently did not accept this rebuke in very good spirit,
for in January Colonel Love wrote Jackson that &ldquo;Steele said he
wrote you as he could not please you you had better look out for
some other person.&rdquo; Colonel Love volunteered the view, however,
that &ldquo;He in my opinion has not the least intention of going
away. I am confident your last letter will make him the more
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
particular and attentive to your orders.&rdquo; Colonel Love proved to
be a good prophet, for Steele held on to his job through 1832;
but at the beginning of 1833 he was succeeded by Burnard W.
Holtzclaw. Holtzclaw was only a fairly satisfactory overseer, and
gave frequent cause for complaint from his absentee employer;
but the Jackson letter files reveal some communications from him
which stamp him as one of the earliest converts to the cause of
simplified spelling. On March 6, 1833, he wrote the General:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>D&rsquo;r Sir, I Recived you letter March 2d. I now inform you that your
famley ar well at presenes and we ar doing well but Samson is ded,
your mares and colts all looks well but the colte wich Andrew bought
of Mr. Robson is ded. The caze I can not Tel. he live 9 days after he
came Home. I Cut hym open and on his side I fond a not or a lompe
and by looking I found Two of his Ribes Broke but wase well and on

Verer will indeede. I hav not woold to giv all a sute. March 2d we had
a snow and verry cold. I hav a bout one 100 and 50 acres of land plowg
for corn and cotton. last year you made 36 Bales of Cotton but ship
41 Bales.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His brief and unadorned announcement of the death of Samson,
one of the slaves, and his careful recital of all the gory details
of his post-mortem dissection of the colt afford a very good
index of Mr. Holtzclaw&rsquo;s character and capacity for the position
he held. Another example of his Chaucerian English is found in
his letter of October 21, when he wrote to the General as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recived your Letter on the 20 of October. I am glade to Say we are
all well at Presant. your Family are all in good Halth at this time and
are gitting alongue as well as I can. you wish to know abought your

woods late. water Stands after a Rain for 2 weeks. by feding all winter
on the Place can git water to Stand 6 or 8 month in the yeare. cut out
all the under groth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Holtzclaw&rsquo;s performance as an overseer may have left something
to be desired; but there must have been a spark of genius in
one who could stumble upon &ldquo;gratele&rdquo; as the right way to spell
&ldquo;great deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Holtzclaw was also shrewd enough to meet the complaints
against the quality of his services with the suggestion of increased
remuneration when his contract expired at the end of 1833; but
General Jackson sternly wrote Andrew (his adopted son), then
married and residing at the Hermitage, that he had written the
ambitious overseer that he could not expect to receive more money&mdash;&ldquo;that
no farm in Davidson will justify it; that better to abandon
farming than to keep it up for the benefit of an overseer, bringing
me in debt, as it has for two years past.&rdquo; Jackson, however, in
line with his policy of encouraging Andrew to assume a man&rsquo;s
responsibility, told him that he could use his own judgment about
re&euml;ngaging Holtzclaw.</p>
<p>The upshot of this matter was that Holtzclaw passed on and a
new overseer, Williams, was engaged; but he lasted only one
year. The General, writing to Andrew in November, 1834, said:
&ldquo;I knew, the moment I saw the cultivation of the farm, that Mr.
Williams was of no account; that you would have been better
off without him; that he was only a screen to the negroes; know
nothing about cultivation and was beholden to the negroes for
instruction what to do. I am happy you will soon be clear of
him.&rdquo; Further in his letter he grumbled about &ldquo;the worthlessness
of our overseers for the last three years&rdquo; and urged that in engaging
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
a successor to Mr. Williams there be set down in writing an
understanding of what the overseer should do. &ldquo;Let him fully
understand what he is to do, viz, to attend not only to the farm
but to the spinning and weaving, to the feeding of the hands, to
weighing out the meat, and to having them clothed in due season
and the clothing well made by our own seamstresses; to attend to
all the stock, and particularly to see that our blooded stock is taken
good care of when you are absent. These things should all be
enumerated in your agreement, or he may saye hereafter that nothing
but what was enumerated was he bound to take the superintendence
of. Remember the old adage: &lsquo;Deal with all men as
though they were rogues&rsquo;; if honest you are safe, but if not then
your written agreement speaks for itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next man to take up the overseer&rsquo;s duties was Edward
Hobbs, recommended by Colonel Love as &ldquo;a first-rate man.&rdquo; Jackson,
however, was not entirely reassured by his recommendation
for in April, 1935, he wrote his son: &ldquo;I fear from the weather we
experience here that Mr. Hobbs has run a great risque by planting
his cotton so early, as he writes me he has planted the church
field in cotton and on the 13th would begin to plant the balance.&rdquo;
But it was not long before the General was writing: &ldquo;The progress
Mr. Hobbs has made shows him to be a man of judgment; that
he has reduced the hands to good subordination and in doing
this he has gained their confidence and attachment. Say to him
that I am thus far delighted with his course and proceedings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Overseer Hobbs seemed to have a very good grasp of conditions
on the plantation, as evidenced by an intelligent, straight-forward
letter he wrote to Andrew, junior, in August while the
latter was spending the summer vacation with the General at the
Rip Raps. This letter, reflecting the manifold and variegated
duties of an overseer of that time, reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yours and your father&rsquo;s of the 6th and 7th was duly received last
Sunday and your directions concerning the purchase of some mares shall
be attended to. I will of course get them on as good terms as possible,
and I will not purchase at all without I can get suitable ones. I will also
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
use my best exertions in selling your riding horses. I could of sold your
grey horse long since had it not of been for his eye, as also the bay colt.</p>
<p>As respects the tap for the screw (of the gin), I have written you on
the subject long since. I had the pattern made at home by Ned, with the
assistance of Sharp 3 or 4 days to instruct him, and it is now at the furnace.
Col. Armstrong and Col. Love were both here last Saturday and
they informed me the casting would be ready in a few days. I have the
timbers all ready, and so soon as I can get the casting I will put the press
up again. I have the shingles nearly ready for the covering of the gin
house. I shall put them on the side next the cotton scaffold this week,
and should be detained by other jobs with the other side of the covering
it will not interfere with the sunning of the cotton. We have a great
many jobs to do, I fear more than we can possibly get through with,
such as fixing our corn houses so they can be locked up, repairing lot
fences, and one or two of the negro houses wants new shingles. Ned
lost two or three weeks piddling at the pattern, which put us back at
our jobs very much.</p>
<p>We have all our winter cloth for the negroes done but two pieces to
weave. We will soon be done with that job. Our shoes I have not yet
began. I have been trying my best to get the leather for three weeks and
have not yet got it; however, I suppose it will be ready this week and I
will then soon have them made.</p>
<p>I shall finish gathering of fodder this week and I think when I come
to stack I shall have a fine chance. I hope you will not have to buy fodder,
corn and oats next year.</p>
<p>Our neighbors are becoming a little alarmed about our cotton crops
on account of the very cold rainy weather. All of our neighbors planted
their cotton 3 foot and 3&frac12; foot distance and it is now very thick, locked
up very close. If this weather holds it is impossible it can make a crop.
Most of our cotton is planted 4&frac12; foot, and that is also locked but not so
much. I do not think I have ever seen as cool weather in August as
the past week. Two blankets was hardly sufficient to sleep under. However,
I am glad to see it turning warm again.</p>
<p>I was at Mr. Pool&rsquo;s a few days since and saw the colts gallop. They
appear to be doing finely. Pool makes some considerable calculations
on the black colt and Major Donelson&rsquo;s horse Mombrino. He feels very
confident of taking the four-mile day with him this fall. He has made
a little brush with him and a horse of Squire Robertson&rsquo;s that was trained
with Anville last season and his heels is nothing to Mombrino. Robertson&rsquo;s
horse was faster a little ways than Anville&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>As respects health, the people generally are sickly. Some sickness
amongst us, but nothing serious I believe. Aaron the blacksmith and
Tom Franklin was both taken sick yesterday; very hot fever all night.
I gave them a large dose of calomel and jalap this morning and they
are much better to-night.</p>
<p>I have nothing pleasing to write you about the house. Nothing much
adoing. Two hands at work. I believe the brickwork to the wings not
quite finished. The principal building is covered, and that is all I
can say. Col. Armstrong and Col. Love is both doing their best with the
firm I believe. I think Rieff needs an overseer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hobbs&rsquo;s gloomy forebodings about the cotton crop were discounted
by Colonel Armstrong in a letter to Jackson in which he
said: &ldquo;I expect that you have not had so large and so good a crop
for several years&rdquo;; but within a few weeks an unseasonably early
frost had destroyed these sanguine expectations and in November
Colonel Armstrong was writing sadly: &ldquo;Some plantations will
make half a crop, some a third. I am sorry to say that yours is
very near a loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This crop failure, coming right in the midst of the heavy expense
occasioned by the burning of the Hermitage and most of
its furniture, filled Jackson with misgivings, and he promptly
wrote to Andrew urging him to exercise economy in the management
of the farm and suggesting that one or two of the three-year-old
stud colts might be bartered for work mares in order to avoid
the necessity for a cash outlay for the mares.</p>
<p>At the end of the year Mr. Hobbs was re&euml;ngaged to serve during
1836, but it was not long before the reports received from
the farm convinced the General that proper attention was not being
given the livestock. His keen insight into what was going on
a thousand miles away from him is strikingly shown in a letter
he wrote Andrew in March:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My son: I inclose you a letter received to-day from Mr. Hobbs from
which I infer he pays but little attention to the stock.</p>
<p>When I was at home, when I was engaged both in building, clearing
and farming, I always kept my oxen in good order although I had them
in their yokes daily; but this was done by always attending and seeing
them regularly fed and watered. When I found the driver had neglected
<span class="pb" id="Page_169">169</span>
feeding regularly, I ordered him upon small allowance as well as chastising
him for it, and thus with attention Mr. Parsons kept his 12 oxen as
fat as his horses; but when I see Mr. Hobbs say in his letters that the
young colts look badly notwithstanding that they have enough of corn,
oats and fodder and a dry stable to go into, I want no better proof of the
want of regularity in feeding. They are overfed one day and starved the
next. The hand that attends to them filled their troughs one morning and
perhaps does not see them again in two. It is the overseer&rsquo;s business to
see all the stock daily in the winter season, sometimes in the morning
and again sometimes in the evening; and when he finds the stock
neglected at once punish the hand charged with their keeping. We lost
a great many last year, and when I hear of their bad condition this, and
a plenty to give them, why there must be sheer neglect of them. For this
neglect the overseer is answerable, and I wish to enquire and tell him
frankly that he will be held responsible. That oxen, where there is plenty
of food, at this season of the year are poor and broke down shows that
carelessness in an overseer for which he ought to be dismissed. We have
lost more in stock than two such crops would pay for&mdash;this is truly
pulling out the bung and driving in the spigot. If I live to get home I
will shew you and all overseers how easy it is to keep oxen fat and doing
more business than when neglected and broken down. We must make
better crops and preserve our stock better or we will be soon in a state
of want and poverty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If there was any unforgivable sin with General Jackson it was
neglecting his live stock. Mr. Hobb&rsquo;s doom was sealed. A Mr.
Holliday was engaged for the year 1837&mdash;and that was the year
when Andrew Jackson stepped down from the President&rsquo;s chair
and came back to the Hermitage to live the rest of his days. Early
in January, looking forward to his return home, he wrote Mr.
Holliday instructing him to be sure and plant a good vegetable
garden; and, he added, &ldquo;I want to have my stock so that I can do
something with them when I reach home.&rdquo; And immediately following
the inauguration of President Van Buren he set out for
home and on March 25th he was back at the Hermitage he loved
so well.</p>

<p class="pcap">This plan illustrates the spacious simplicity characteristic of Southern
plantation house plans. The later additions of wings seem so
simple and naturally disposed that one would suspect that they were
preconceived by a trained architect rather than having been worked
out by the owner and itinerant carpenters.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>During the latter months of his administration at Washington
his health had been particularly bad, so bad in fact that when he
started back to Nashville in March, President Van Buren insisted
on sending his own personal physician, Dr. Lawson, to accompany
him on the trip home. Back at the Hermitage he wrote his political
protege and successor to thank him for this attention, and in the
course of his letter he said: &ldquo;I hope rest in due time may restore
my health so as to be able to ride over my farm, and to visit my
good neighbors. This will be a source of amusement and much
pleasure to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gradually his health improved sufficiently for him to assume
active charge of the operation of the farm; and this was a time
when the ablest management was needed to make any enterprise
successful. The country was in the throes of a financial panic,
prices of farm products were depressed, and, as Jackson wrote in
one of his letters early in 1837, negroes that had cost from $1,000
to $1,800 were being sold at sheriff&rsquo;s sales for $300 for women
and $500 for men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest of my life is retirement and ease&rdquo; he wrote to a friend
when he laid down his Presidential cares and went back to the
Hermitage; but, unfortunately for his peace of mind, things did
not work out that way. There was but little ease for the old
General during his remaining eight years at home. The very first
year he was there an unseasonably late spring delayed the germination
of the cotton seed, and during the ensuing summer he was
consumed with apprehension concerning the outcome of the crop.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * *</span></p>
<p>It is interesting to observe that in Jackson&rsquo;s time the principal
&ldquo;money crop&rdquo; of the Hermitage, as well as of the neighboring
plantations, was cotton. Nashville at that time was a cotton market
of major importance, and the number of gins in the county then
shows that there was a large quantity of cotton grown every year
in this vicinity. Today there is not a stalk of cotton grown in the
county; and the nearest gin to Nashville is a small one located
fifteen miles south of the city in an adjoining county where some
of the agricultural die-hards still cultivate the old crop. The
growing season between frosts is really too short in Davidson
County to encourage cotton planting; but the first settlers got
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
started to growing it, and since farmers are traditionally opposed
to change in their habits they continued to plant it even after experience
demonstrated that it was not a profitable year-after-year
crop. As early as 1838 Jackson sensed this fact and wrote to one
of his friends: &ldquo;I will soon have to quit making cotton here&rdquo;&mdash;but
he never did quit.</p>
<p>In spite of the difficulty of raising cotton in a climate not
entirely suited to it, it is noticeable that the Hermitage plantation
had the reputation of making good crops of high-grade staple. In
1832 there was an article in <i>Niles&rsquo; Register</i> commenting on the
fact that fifty-four bales of the Hermitage cotton had sold in New
Orleans at 11&frac12; cents a pound, which was called &ldquo;an extraordinary
price;&rdquo; and the article stated further that it was the best cotton
that had come to New Orleans from Tennessee. In 1826 Jackson&rsquo;s
New Orleans factor, Maunsel White, wrote to him that he
had sold the Hermitage cotton at &ldquo;the very top of the market,&rdquo; the
net proceeds for the crop that year being $3,477.51.</p>
<p>Checking over the references to the sales of the cotton crops in
the Jackson papers it is to be seen that there was a great fluctuation
in the price obtained. The 1844 crop, for instance, brought only
4&frac12; cents a pound, the price ranging from that low mark up to 15
cents for the crop of 1825 and even higher than that during the
boom in cotton following the end of the War of 1812.</p>
<p>In Maunsel White, General Jackson had at New Orleans a
factor who stood high in the cotton trade and who could be depended
on to protect the Tennessee planter in marketing his crops
to the best advantage. Captain White was not only Jackson&rsquo;s factor
but his friend and a former comrade at arms in the New
Orleans campaign, and he took great pride in getting the highest
possible price for the Hermitage crops.</p>
<p>In January, 1831, White wrote to Jackson, then in the White
House, that the flatboats had arrived from the Hermitage with
their cargo of fifty-nine bales and that the overseer was to be congratulated
on its quality and condition as it was &ldquo;without blemish.&rdquo;
The best offer he had got at that time, he wrote, was 9 cents;
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
but he expressed a determination to hold for 10 cents &ldquo;which it
is fully worth&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;unless we receive worse news from the
unsettled state of politics.&rdquo; He mentioned the popular belief that
a general war in Europe was perhaps impending, and slyly added:
&ldquo;On this subject, however, you must be better advised than anyone
else in these states; and if it were not asking too much, or
what were improper for me to ask, I would ask your opinion on
that subject.&rdquo; An inside tip from the President on an impending
war would be worth a fortune to a New Orleans cotton broker;
but there is no evidence that Jackson gave Captain White any information
on the subject. This was before the day of White
House &ldquo;leaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following year White wrote Jackson that he had sold part
of his crop for 11&frac12; cents in New Orleans and shipped part of it
to Liverpool where it commanded 8&frac12;d sterling, stating that &ldquo;your
cotton this year has brought the highest price both at home and
abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the custom of the Hermitage household, when shipping
the cotton crop to Captain White each year, to send along a list
of groceries needed for the year. When sending this year&rsquo;s supply
of groceries back to the Hermitage it was Captain White&rsquo;s custom
to send along some kind of a present to General Jackson&mdash;a barrel
of oranges, or sugar or molasses. It was Captain White&rsquo;s custom
to say jokingly that the present was sent to sweeten General Jackson&rsquo;s
tooth; so in 1842 when the General had his sole remaining
molar extracted he notified his New Orleans friend that it would
no longer be necessary to sweeten his tooth as his last tooth was
gone.</p>
<p>The passing of the Jacksonian teeth, by the way, had an amusing
aftermath. Learning of his toothless condition, a celebrated
dentist asked the privilege of making him a set of false teeth,
seeing in it an opportunity to gain some publicity for himself. The
General consented and the teeth were produced after careful
measurements had been made. False teeth of that day were still of
rather crude design, the upper and lower plates being hinged together
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
at the back and the opening and closing facilitated by
means of a spring. General Jackson gave his new teeth their first
try-out on the occasion of a public dinner in Nashville; but while
partaking of the first course he had the misfortune to have the
spring get stuck in such a way that he could not close his mouth.
He managed to remove the offending apparatus behind the cover
of his napkin, but he was much embarrassed by the episode and
returned the teeth to the dentist who made them with the suggestion
that they might be generously presented to some &ldquo;poor
widow woman in need of the like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson was a progressive farmer and was prompt to
adopt new methods and devices. The cotton gin was first introduced
into Tennessee in 1803; and the state of Tennessee purchased
from the inventor, Eli Whitney, the patent rights for the
state, enacting legislation which placed a tax on all gins. There
being some dispute about the legal title to the machine, the arrangement
was not perfected until late in 1806, at which time
a model gin was set up in Knoxville and one in Nashville, these
models to serve as patterns for the citizens who wanted to build
gins. Jackson was among the first to install a gin in his part of the
state, and the minutes of the Davidson County court show that he
made bond of $5,000 and subscribed to the following oath: &ldquo;I,
Andrew Jackson, do solemnly swear that I will well and truly inspect
or cause to be inspected all bales of cotton that shall pass
through my press, marking the bales according to the goodness
thereof, agreeable to the directions of the act of the Assembly in
such cases made and provided; so help me God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Jackson had recurring bad luck with his cotton crop
from time to time up to the very year of his death. On February
10th, 1845, just four months before he died, in a letter to A. J.
Donelson, then United States Minister to the Republic of Texas,
he mentioned that his current crop of cotton, amounting to
37,000 pounds, had been &ldquo;forced into the market&rdquo; (for what
reason is not revealed) and that it netted only $1,312. This, he
said, after paying the overseer and drafts on the cotton &ldquo;left us
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
only $36 to pay our debts here.&rdquo; To add to his discomfiture at this
time, his overseer in Mississippi misappropriated the proceeds of
that plantation&rsquo;s crop and left the General in a temporary financial
stringency. But Jackson immediately put hands to work cutting
wood on the Mississippi plantation (wood was the fuel for the
Mississippi River steamboats then), and stated that if this did not
relieve him from debt he was determined to sell the lower plantation
and enough of its slaves to put him square with the world
again.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * *</span></p>
<p>Although cotton was looked upon as the principal and most
important crop of the Hermitage farm, the General really derived
the greatest personal pleasure (and a substantial part of his
income) from the horses that were raised on the farm.</p>
<p>When he resigned from the Superior Court of Tennessee in
1804 and concentrated all his ability and energy on the rehabilitation
of his private affairs, he wisely decided to go into stock-breeding
on an ambitious scale. He was admirably suited to the
business of breeding fine horses. In the first place, he admired and
loved a fine piece of horseflesh. From his earliest youth he had
been interested in racing, gaining his first taste of &ldquo;the sport of
kings&rdquo; at the Charleston meets in his youthful days when he was
living with the Crawfords. When he came to Tennessee he came
riding one blooded horse and leading another, and he was always
to be found among the foremost spectators or participants
if there were a horse-race anywhere in his neighborhood. He loved
horses and, in the words of one of his biographers, &ldquo;he knew all
about the noble animal from pedigree to pathology.&rdquo; That is no
idle use of words, either, for Andrew Jackson studied horses,
their records and their breeding; and, in an emergency, he showed
that he was skilled in the art of the veterinary surgeon. A goodly
share of the books in his library are on the subject of horses and
the turf.</p>
<p>It was characteristic of Jackson&rsquo;s vision and good business sense
that when he decided to go into the breeding of horses as a money-making
venture he purchased to head his establishment the horse
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
that was then recognized as the very finest in the whole country.
This horse, Truxton by name, was owned by a Virginia horseman,
Major John Verrell. At just about the time that Jackson was casting
about looking for a stallion worthy to head the thoroughbred
nursery he was planning, Truxton was matched for a race at Hartsville,
near Nashville, with a Tennessee horse called Greyhound,
belonging to Lazarus Colton. Greyhound won the race, but Major
Verrell, insisted that such an outcome of the contest could have
been possible only because of Truxton&rsquo;s being out of proper condition
or improperly handled; and, to show the sincerity of his belief,
he came to Nashville from Virginia for the purpose of arranging
a return match between Greyhound and Truxton when
the latter could have been given the personal attention of his
proud owner.</p>
<p>Major Verrell must have had an eloquent and persuasive
tongue, or else Truxton must have possessed the qualities of a top-notch
thoroughbred that shone undimmed through defeat. At any
rate, General Jackson became convinced that Truxton was really
a better horse than Greyhound; and the General, who was the
major domo of sport in Tennessee in those days, made arrangements
for another race at Hartsville between Truxton and Greyhound
for a purse of $5,000.</p>
<p>This race was a Titanic affair in turf history, and attracted tremendous
interest. Mr. Douglas Anderson, in his <i>Making the
American Thoroughbred</i>, says: &ldquo;No contest on the soil of Tennessee
has ever been so exciting or caused so much betting, considering
the means of the people, as this race. Hundreds of horses
and numerous 640-acre tracts of land were staked on the result.
The old pioneers bet on Greyhound with the utmost confidence.&rdquo;
Imagine the consternation of the old pioneers, therefore, when
Major Verrell&rsquo;s stallion very handily defeated the Tennessee
horse in straight heats. Many a Tennessee farmer walked home
from that race carrying his saddle. General Jackson, in addition to
his share of the purse in cash, stated that he won &ldquo;$1,500 in wearing
apparel,&rdquo; although unfortunately he left behind him no details
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
of this interesting side bet. Foremost among the backers of Truxton
was General Jackson&rsquo;s racing crony, Patton Anderson, who was
not content with betting his own horse and all his money but also
with reckless daring wagered 15 other horses that did not actually
belong to him. It must have been a relief to the super-confident
Mr. Anderson when the race was over; and it is easy
to understand the enthusiasm that led him, after the race, to
&ldquo;set &rsquo;em up&rdquo; to a barrel of cider and a basketful of ginger snaps.</p>
<p>As a result of the showing Truxton made in this race, General
Jackson bought the horse from Major Verrell; and the publicity
given this great turf upset placed the racing spotlight on the
Hermitage stud and made it an immediate success.</p>
<p>Writing about his famous horse in the <i>American Farmer</i>, as
quoted in the Turf Register of December, 1833, General Jackson
said: &ldquo;Truxton is a beautiful bay, full of bone and muscle; was
got by the imported old Diomed and came out of the thoroughbred
mare, Nancy Coleman. His performances on the turf have
surpassed those of any horse of his age that has ever been run in
the western country; and indeed it might be said with confidence
that he is equal if not superior to Mr. Ball&rsquo;s Florizel who now
stands unrivaled in Virginia as a race horse. Truxton by old
sportsmen and judges is admitted to be amongst the best distance
horses they ever run or ever had to train.&rdquo; And the General concludes,
with a touch of sardonic humor: &ldquo;His speed is certainly
known to all of those who have run against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A historian of the turf records that while Truxton was alive
and serviceable he &ldquo;made more money for Andrew Jackson than
any other single piece of property he ever owned.&rdquo; This has the
earmarks of exaggeration, but Truxton was really a remarkable
animal. Not only did he hold the unusual record of never having
been beaten in a two-mile heat while he was in his prime; but he
was the sire of more than 400 colts whose victorious records on
every track made turf history. During the relatively few years that
Truxton lived his colts literally overshadowed all other horses on
the tracks of the then Southwest, and Tennessee became the recognized
headquarters of horse-breeding. Other breeders came to
the Hermitage farm for young brood mares and stallions of the
Truxton stock; and there is little doubt that the publicity that
came to Andrew Jackson through these activities contributed
very largely to the widespread friendships which were so valuable
to him politically in the years ahead.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>Jackson truly loved all his horses, and was especially fond of
Truxton; and, so tradition goes, Truxton returned his affection.
Not a night went by that the General did not go himself to the
stables before retiring for the night to see that Truxton was all
right; and when Truxton grew old and unruly, there was never
a time when Jackson could not control him, no matter how ugly
his mood.</p>
<p>And, tragically enough, it was Truxton who was the indirect
cause of placing the General in one of the most unfortunate crises
of his life; for it was the race between Truxton and Ploughboy
in 1805 which was the ostensible cause of the fatal duel in which
Jackson killed young Charles Dickinson.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * *</span></p>
<p>In the Presidential campaign of 1828 General Jackson was referred
to by the friendly press as &ldquo;The Farmer of Tennessee;&rdquo; but
this phrase was not used in a spirit of praise by all the newspapers
of the day. For instance, a typically partisan editorial in the <i>New
York American</i> said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let us see what is the Farmer of Tennessee? Possessing a fine and
extensive domain with a vast mansion, not a farm-house but The Hermitage,
surrounded by a host of slaves&mdash;this farmer of Tennessee eats
the bread of idleness and luxury. The whip of the overseer quickens
the servile labors whereby he&mdash;one of those priviliged beings born to
consume the fruits of the earth&mdash;is sustained; and men, immortal as himself,
are daily &ldquo;driven a-field&rdquo; like oxen and their strength taxed to the
uttermost, perhaps, that he, their master, may add another race-horse to
his stud or stake an additional bet upon a favorite game-cock. Of personal
labor the hands of this &ldquo;farmer&rdquo; are innocent; for, where slavery
exists, labor is held to degrade the white man.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Andrew Jackson had his faults, and he was open to criticism
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
from many angles; but to hold him up as an example of the cruel
and heartless type of Southern slaveholder was to confess an utter
ignorance of his attitude towards his slaves. The records tell of a
slave named Sam at the Hermitage whom Jackson freed in 1816
but who refused to leave the place.</p>
<p>Nowhere in his public writings or in his private correspondence
does Jackson give any evidence of ever questioning the legitimacy
of the institution of slavery; but throughout all his letters there are
innumerable indications of his inflexible determination to see
that his slaves were treated humanely and fairly. Upon learning
of the death of one of them in 1829, for instance, he immediately
wrote to Andrew instructing him &ldquo;to examine minutely into this
matter, and if the death was produced by the cruelty of Mr. Steel
have him forthwith discharged.&rdquo; Going on, he says: &ldquo;When I
employed Mr. Steel I charged him upon this subject and had expressed
in our agreement that he was to treat them with great
humanity, feed and clothe them well and work them in moderation.
If he has deviated from this rule he must be discharged.&rdquo;
Later, following Andrew&rsquo;s report of his investigation, the General
wrote expressing great gratification that the death had not resulted
from the overseer&rsquo;s cruelty.</p>
<p>In 1833, while he was still in Washington, two more slaves
died, and William Donelson wrote the General expressing the
opinion that the deaths had grown out of lack of proper medical
attention. Immediately Jackson was on the warpath again. He
wrote Andrew strongly urging him to investigate the charges of
neglect; and, to make doubly sure of getting the facts, he wrote
to his old and trusted friend Major William B. Lewis, asking him
to look into the matter and let him know what was going on.
Major Lewis made a typically thorough and painstaking investigation
and his letter, reporting conditions as he found them, gives
such a clear and interesting detailed account of life on a Tennessee
plantation of a century ago that it is worth preserving in its
entirety:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have this moment returned from a visit to the Hermitage. I left
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
home after an early breakfast and got up there between ten and eleven
o&rsquo;clock, where I remained until after breakfast this morning.</p>
<p>It is with pleasure I inform you that I found every individual, big
and little, well, except Hannah, Sally&rsquo;s eldest child, and she, I was told
by the overseer and her mother, was getting better. I had her brought
to the house so that I might see her myself and ascertain, if I could, the
nature of her complaint. I was apprehensive from what Mr. Holtzclaw
told me that she was afflicted with the hip complaint, such as Major
Barry&rsquo;s son had; but on interrogating her and her mother as to the origin
of the disease I am inclined to think it is something else. Mr. Holtzclaw
and some of the black people think it is the white swelling. Her
mother told me when she first complained of a pain in the hip she
examined her and found a large lump in her groin having the appearance
of what is called a waxen kernel. She also told me she complained
not only of pain in the hip but also in the thick or muscular part of the
thigh, and particularly the knee. As I do not know how those who
have the hip complaint are affected, I can not say whether these are
synptoms of that disease or not. When she was first taken, Sally tells
me, she could not walk at all and suffered much pain. She can now
walk a little, and her pains are not so distressing. Indeed she told me
she suffered little or no pain except of nights. I thought this was owing
probably to her taking too much exercise in the day, and I told her she
must walk very little on her leg until it got better. I also charged her
mother to keep her from exercising too much. She is a very pretty little
girl, and as she will no doubt make a valuable servant if she lives and
gets well I have some thought of getting Dr. Hogg to ride up and see
her, for I am apprehensive Dr. McCorkle does not understand the nature
of her complaint. If she should require any personal attention afterwards
she might be brought down (to Nashville) and left with her
grandmother who lives on Parson&rsquo;s lot, College Hill, and would take
good care of her. The old woman (old Aunt Nanny, you know) was
up to see her not long since, the overseer informed me, and was very
anxious to take her down with her, but that he did not feel authorized
to let her go. When next you write to me let me know your wishes with
regard to this matter and Hannah will be treated in all respects as you
may direct.</p>
<p>The farm is in pretty good order. The fences all look strong and
good, and particularly the outer ones. I was told by the negroes that
nearly all the fencing on the Donelson lands had been repaired&mdash;most
of it, also, round the caney field. I did not see them but I have no
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
doubt it is so. Some of the fences around the lots and stables have also
been repaired, as well as the outer fence north of your brick negro
houses. I think there is no fault to be found with any portion of the
fencing&mdash;some few of the fences about the lots which need it have not
yet been repaired; but the overseer says he intends giving his attention
to them the first wet spell. He has made you some ten or twelve new
gates and hung them. They are well made and well hung.</p>
<p>The house looks, I presume, pretty much as it did when you were here
last summer. I thought that perhaps it had not been sufficiently aired,
and I directed Hannah, who seems to have charge of it, to open the doors
and windows whenever the weather is dry and pleasant. The yard and
garden look badly&mdash;neither is attended to as they should be. This,
however, is more Dick&rsquo;s fault than the overseer&rsquo;s, as he has necessarily
been much and constantly engaged in getting in his crop and withal I
suspect he has very little taste for gardening. I told Dick he must put
the garden in order forthwith and keep it so; that the walks, borders and
squares must all be cleaned and kept so. The overseer promised me that
in future he would pay more attention to Dick and the garden and yard.</p>
<p>Finding the yard pretty much grown up with weeds, indeed the back
part of it entirely taken with the green plantain, I directed the overseer
to take his hoes into it the first rain that fell and scrape the whole of it
over, not leaving a weed or spear of grass inside of the paling in front
or rear of the house, and to keep it so until the last of September when
he must chop it over lightly and sow it down thickly with good blue
grass seed unmixed with any other. These orders were given because I
did not calculate on your visiting the Hermitage this summer; and by the
next, if the blue grass seed comes up well, it will look much better than
it now does or ever has done.</p>
<p>As you requested, I looked also at the monument in the garden. Its
appearance is very good, but I do not think it is finished entirely as it
should be. The circular stones which rest upon the columns should also
be plastered in the interior as is the case with the dome above. This is
necessary in order to hide the joints and rough appearance of the stonework.
There are also many rough places and little holes in the columns
themselves, owing to defects in the stones, which should be filled up
and nicely painted over. In addition to this, I would suggest that neat
little iron railing be thrown around it at the distance of four feet from
the base of the monument and paved all around with nicely dressed
flagstones similar to those which cover the tombs. This would not cost
very much and would give a handsome finish to the monument, which
I think quite tasty and appropriate.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>I sent for old Aunt Hannah, who has charge of the poultry, and told
her that you had been very mortified at finding on your return to the
Hermitage no fowls or poultry of any kind for the use of the table, and
that you wished me to say to her that you hoped it would never be the
case again. She assured me that she would do her best to raise a plentiful
supply, but said that her chickens and turkeys died very much with the
gapes which, with everything she could do, she could not prevent. The
overseer, she said, had built her a good house and she expected now she
would be able to take better care of them. She has a very good stock of
turkeys to raise from. I counted twelve hens and four gobblers; and, as
I understood from her, she has a pretty good supply of chickens, etc.</p>
<p>I inquired of the overseer with regard to your horses, cattle, hogs and
sheep. He told me his work horses were in very good order and were
sufficient to tend his crop. He runs at this time 17 plows, but says that
if necessary he can run 19. I sent also for Ben who, I was told, had
charge of the plow horses, and inquired of him as to their condition. He
said they all were in pretty good order and were thriving. He informed
me that they had lost a young mule but did not seem to think that blame
should attach to anyone. I saw some of the plow horses myself and if
the balance are in as good order they will do very well. The overseer
informed me that he had 60 grown cows and yearlings and 22 young
calves, making altogether of all descriptions 82. The cattle look as well
as is usual for this season of the year. He has about 300 head of hogs;
of this number there will be, he thinks, about 80 or 90 large enough to
kill next fall, which he hopes will be sufficient or nearly so for the use
of the farm. He further informed me that of the 300 head, 100 of them
were pigs not more than a month old. Your flock of sheep look very
well. I inquired of Mr. Holtzclaw the number. He told me there were
92 old sheep and 59 lambs.</p>
<p>I paid Dunn a visit at his stables and looked at all his horses and colts,
and I assure you that I was much pleased and gratified at their appearance.
The horse Citizen is in fine order and condition; he is really a
beautiful animal. The two three-year old fillies are also in fine condition.
I think the one by Stockholder much the finest of the two, but the
other is also a fine animal. His colts too (three in number) are in good
order and very playful. Indeed, all of his horses are quite fat, as much
so as there is any use for. One of your mares, the overseer informed me,
was in Williamson (County) and as he would have soon to send for
her he wishes me to say to you that he would want some money&mdash;$40 I
think he said&mdash;to pay for her season and keeping.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<p>Upon the whole, if Mr. Holtzclaw will hold out as he has begun I
think he will make you a good crop, if he has a good stand of cotton
and the season suits, and take very good care of your stock. He feels,
however, considerable uneasiness with regard to his cotton crop&mdash;he is
afraid his stand will not be a good one. His seed, he says, were not
good, nor could he get those that were good anywhere. He finished
planting yesterday, the 20th of April, while I was at the Hermitage. He
says he could have planted a week earlier, but not having confidence in
the soundness of his seed he did not like to risk them sooner. He will
finish planting his corn tomorrow. He tells me he has 200 acres in cotton,
considerably upwards of 300 acres in corn, and something like 120
or 130 acres in oats. He has his sweet potatoes planted, and in the piece
of fresh land on the left hand of the gate as you approach the house. I
enquired of him particularly about your meadows and timothy. He
says no hay, he is afraid, can be made off them. Indeed, he says one
piece (adjoining the lot Dunn&rsquo;s stables are in) was so taken with weeds
that he found it necessary to plow it up and put it in corn. He thinks
that by tending it well this summer the weeds may be killed; and then,
by sowing it down again in timothy, it might bring good grass. I looked
at the ground, and by its appearance I have no doubt he done right in
ploughing it up&mdash;it must have been very much taken by weeds. He has
not ploughed up the other, but he is afraid it will not make hay. He
say it was badly rooted up by the pigs and hogs last fall, and has now
more weeds than grass in it. Your two fields of clover look very well,
and a good deal of hay can be made off one of them (the one opposite
the cotton gin) as Mr. Holtzclaw intends mowing it. The other, he says,
he is obliged to pasture.</p>
<p>I enquired of Mr. Holtzclaw about the sickness on the place in the
early part of the spring and the cause of so many negroes dying. He told
me that he thought the cholera had visited that neighborhood, and that
some of your negroes had died of that disease, particularly Titus, whose
death he seemed very much to regret as he was a fine hand and a most
valuable servant. He did not seem, however, to be satisfied in his own
mind that either the girl or the two Samsons died of that disease. He
says Dr. McCorkle saw Titus on the Sunday evening before his death
and said he was well again and would be able to go to work on Monday
morning. At 11 o&rsquo;clock Sunday night he was a corpse. Now, my
dear sir. I doubt very much whether the cholera has ever been at the
Hermitage or its neighborhood. I heard of its being nowhere else, except
a reported case on Major Donelson&rsquo;s farm. Mr. Donelson&rsquo;s negro, who
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
was supposed to be attacked with the cholera, recovered and is now well.
I think Titus must have died of some other disease.</p>
<p>I had heard at Nashville that Mr. Holtzclaw was very severe with the
negroes, but from my own observation and what the negroes themselves
told me while there I think probably he is not more so than is necessary.
Where there are so many negroes there must be a pretty rigid police. I
told him that I had heard of his severity, but I hoped he had given no
foundation for such reports about him. I added that you knew the necessity
of keeping order on the place and among the negroes, but that I was
sure that you did not wish nor would you permit your negroes knowingly
to be treated with cruelty. I hoped therefore that he would not use
towards them an unnecessary severity. He assured me that he had not
and would not. I told him if an overseer would be constantly himself
with his hands very little whipping would be required. The best way
of managing negroes, according to my experience, was to treat them
kindly when they done well, and to punish them reasonably when they
misbehaved; but that he might be assured that no negroes would conduct
themselves well who were left too much to themselves&mdash;that someone
for whom they had either respect or fear should always be near at hand.
He concurred with me in this opinion and said that he scarcely ever was
off the place unless obliged by business.</p>
<p>Your negroes evidently are better clad than they were under Mr.
Steele&rsquo;s administration. They informed me that they all got their
quantum of winter clothing, and most of them have already been furnished
with their summer clothing. I did not see a single child even
on the place that was not well clad, and Mr. Holtzclaw informed me
that there were 58 of them. He keeps his wheel constantly going, and
he informed me that it spins six or seven yards every day&mdash;besides the
spinning ginney that he says he keeps constantly going.</p>
<p>I believe, my dear General, I have given you all the information I have
with regard to the Hermitage, its culture and management. If there
should be anything else you wish me to attend to, let me know and it
shall be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The old General was mollified by Major Lewis&rsquo;s painstaking
report of conditions at the Hermitage, and wrote him thanking
him for relieving him of the &ldquo;great anxiety and pain&rdquo; under
which he had been laboring as a result of the reports he had been
receiving of the overseer&rsquo;s excessive severity. Regarding Hannah,
the little girl with the sore hip, he wrote:</p>
<div class="img" id="img2">
<img id="ill2" src="images/p44.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="725" />
<p class="pcap">SECOND FLOOR PLAN</p>
<p class="pcap">Allowing for the use of the then customary armoirs in place of the
present-day closets and the fact that bathrooms were non-existent at
the time, the most confirmed modernist could find no fault with this
arrangement for living.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>I will thank you to get Dr. Hogg to see Hannah. I would be sorry she
would become a cripple. You may say to Dr. Hogg that her lameness
was occasioned by a stroke from Betty, or jumping over a rope in which
her feet became entangled and she fell and hurt her hip. I will thank
you to say to the overseer to prevent Betty from beating or cruelly using
the little negroes that are under her about the kitchen. A small switch
only ought to be used, but sometimes she uses any weapon she can get,
and chokes and abuses them and brings on disease. Give such directions
about the negro girl as though she was your own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was not the first time he had had cause to complain to the
conduct of Betty, the cook. Back in 1821, while he was in Florida
at grips with the Spanish officials, word reached him from the
Hermitage that this same Betty, then Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s maid, had
been misbehaving; and he set aside his dispute with Se&ntilde;or Calava
long enough to write to A. J. Donelson:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mrs. Jackson informs me that her maid Betty has been putting on
some airs and has been guilty of a great deal of impudence. On this
subject I have wrote Dr. Brunaugh and Mr. Blair. I have said to Mr.
Blair that I hold him responsible for the control of the servants, and I
have directed that the first impertinence she uses or the first disobedience
of orders that she is to be publicly whipped. It is humiliating to me to
have to resort to this, but I have to request of you to observe her conduct
and the first disobedience or impudence order Mr. Blair to give her fifty
lashes. If he does not perform it, dismiss him, and as soon as I get possession
I will order a corporal to give it to her publicly. I am determined
to cure her.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This evidence of firmness on General Jackson&rsquo;s part in the
discipline of the slaves was very unusual, and indicates that the
offending Betty must have worn out his patience with her incorrigibility.
Seldom indeed was whipping resorted to on the Hermitage
plantation. In fact, the principal criticism of Jackson
around Nashville, regarding his treatment of his slaves, was that
he was too lenient with them; and out of this leniency grew a
tragedy in 1827 that became one of the minor controversial issues
of the 1828 Presidential campaign.</p>
<p>One of Jackson&rsquo;s slaves, a man named Gilbert, was a chronic
and incurable runaway; but upon every such offense he was always
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
forgiven by the General upon his promise of better behavior.
This went on until at length Jackson&rsquo;s patience was exhausted
and when Gilbert was recaptured after running away in 1827 the
General ordered him taken to Nashville and sold, with the stipulation
that he must be sold as a runaway so that any purchaser
would know of that defect. The overseer, Ira Walton, however,
gave it as his opinion that this would not do, inasmuch as it was
the prevailing idea that the Hermitage negroes had been detrimentally
affected by their master&rsquo;s indulgence and that one of
them would be correspondingly hard to sell. Walton further said
that if some example were not made of an habitual offender like
Gilbert he could not promise to keep the slaves under control,
and that Gilbert was a fit subject for punishment inasmuch as he
was the most insolent slave on the place.</p>
<p>Jackson, over-persuaded, reluctantly instructed Walton to take
Gilbert away from the house to a near-by woods lot that adjoined
a cotton field where other negroes were working and there to
&ldquo;whip him moderately with switches.&rdquo; Arriving at the woods lot,
Gilbert who was described as &ldquo;a very stout, strong man, possessed
of a most violent and ungovernable temper,&rdquo; suddenly turned on
the overseer and knocked him to the ground. Walton hastily
drew a knife from his pocket, but it was only after a long and
bloody struggle that he succeeded in stabbing the negro sufficiently
to free himself. Jackson was quickly summoned from the
house, and he ordered the wounded slave carried back there where
he was given attention by the family doctor. In spite of this attention,
however, he died the next day.</p>
<p>Jackson was very much upset by the tragic episode and, for
some reason, did not believe the overseer&rsquo;s story of the affray. He
not only discharged the overseer summarily the next morning, but
went to Nashville and swore out a warrant for his arrest on a
charge of murder. The grand jury, however, after hearing all the
evidence including the testimony of a negro eye-witness, discharged
Walton on the grounds of self-defense.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of the nature of the Presidential campaign
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
of 1828 that this incident was taken up by Jackson&rsquo;s political
enemies and tortured into the charge that he had deliberately and
heartlessly encouraged and condoned the murder of one of his
defenseless slaves; but this charge was quickly exploded when
Walton, who certainly had no reason to distort the facts in Jackson&rsquo;s
favor, made a sworn public statement telling just what took
place.</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s benevolent attitude toward his slaves was strikingly
illustrated early in 1839 when four of them, including his personal
servant, George, were prosecuted for the alleged murder of
another negro, a slave named Frank belonging to Stockley Donelson.
Donelson had Jackson&rsquo;s four negroes indicted for the murder,
but the General rushed to their defense and successfully engineered
their case. The best legal talent was employed and the
General attended court in person every day while the trial lasted.
The affair cost him $1,500 in money, in addition to his loss of
time and injury to his then feeble health, but his negroes were acquitted
and he felt amply repaid.</p>
<p>During Jackson&rsquo;s lifetime, and long afterwards, in Tennessee
his kindness and indulgence in his relations with his slaves were
proverbial. It was a standing joke with the overseers during the
days when he was active in politics and spending much of his
time away from home that whenever he returned and spent much
time at the Hermitage he spoiled the slaves by his leniency to such
an extent that it took a good while to get them back into working
shape after he had left. He would brook no imposition on any of
them, and it is recorded that he one day made a special trip to
Lebanon to seek out and thrash a man named Grayson who had
had the temerity to strike with a whip Truxton&rsquo;s black groom,
Ephriam. No wonder the slaves all crowded around him and
literally wept with joy when he returned to the Hermitage in the
summer of 1830, his first visit home after his election to the
Presidency.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<h2 id="c9">IX: CHURCH AND RELIGION, AND FINAL DAYS</h2>
<p>One of the most picturesque adjuncts to the Hermitage
is the little Presbyterian church, known far and wide as
the Hermitage Church, although in the formal Presbyterian
records it was officially designated Ephesus. The visitor
coming out from Nashville sees it in a grove of trees on the right-hand
side of the present road just before he turns off to the left
into the lane that leads down to the Hermitage. It is a severely
plain and simple little brick structure, the homeliest sort of example
of ecclesiastical architecture, without steeple or tower or
portico. Inside there are stiff pews of sturdy oak (the one in which
Jackson sat is marked with a silver plate) facing a plain and unadorned
pulpit, and there is a fireplace at each end. It is floored
with bricks, and originally the only lighting fixtures were candlesticks;
but in late years Mrs. Sarah York Jackson presented the
church with the handsome bronze lamps which are still in use.</p>
<p>There is a graveyard facing the road in front of the church,
but this is not the familiar churchyard burying-ground so often
seen in connection with country churches. It is the cemetery of the
near-by Confederate Soldiers&rsquo; Home. The Hermitage church&rsquo;s
members all had family burying-grounds on their farms, and the
church had no need for such facilities. It is said, as a matter of
fact, that there was never but one funeral ceremony held at the
church and this was in 1906 when the remains of Colonel Andrew
Jackson, III, were brought from Knoxville where he died to be
buried in the garden at the Hermitage. The Hermitage church
had little to do with funerals, although it was draped in crepe for
three years in honor of General Jackson when he died.</p>
<p>The traditional story is that General Jackson built this church
for his wife, but this is hardly accurate, although the General
himself customarily referred to it as &ldquo;Mrs. Jackson&rsquo;s church.&rdquo;
The fact is that the church was built in 1823 by popular subscription
by the people of the neighborhood. The cost of the building
was $800, but when the subscription paper was circulated it
raised only $120. The remaining $680 was subscribed by seven
men; and Jackson, being about the wealthiest and most prominent
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
resident of the community, naturally contributed most liberally.
Active with him in promoting the church was Colonel Edward
Ward, the neighbor who bought the Hunter&rsquo;s Hill place from
him; the various members of the Donelson family paid a share of
the expense; and all the other neighbors contributed more or less.
The money was not raised without difficulty, however; and in December,
1823, Jackson wrote to his wife asking how the work of
building progressed and bidding her to see Colonel Ward and
urge him to push the work along. &ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; wrote the General,
&ldquo;that it must be finished, if him and myself pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earlier in the year Colonel Ward had written General Jackson
at some length about the new church, particularly about the best
method of raising the money for the minister&rsquo;s salary. It had been
proposed that they follow the plan of renting pews, but Colonel
Ward expressed doubt as to the practicability of this plan. &ldquo;I can
not think of more than 12 or 15 persons that would purchase
seats,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;and from the very good neighborhood feelings
that prevail with us there would be no competition excited
in the sale of them. The consequence would be that the
seats would sell for just as little as each person would think
proper to bid for them. I am fearful that a plan of this sort is not
well calculated for the country, particularly in a thinly populated
neighborhood like ours; furthermore, I should fear that it would
not be generally pleasing and might frequently operate against
the attendance of persons not immediately interested in or connected
with the church.&rdquo; The Colonel closed by saying that he
would &ldquo;with promptitude&rdquo; subscribe to whatever plan was decided
on for the church&rsquo;s support. General Jackson also evidently
did not take to the idea of selling pews&mdash;it is easy to believe that
he wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;and the record shows that this idea was dropped.</p>
<p>As originally built, the entrance to the church was on the eastern
side of the building, facing the old Sanders Ferry Road,
traces of which may still be seen today; but in 1838 when that
road was abandoned and the Lebanon Turnpike was built, it was
considered necessary to move the doors to their present location
<span class="pb" id="Page_189">189</span>
in the south end so as to avoid having the church present its back
to the new road. To defray the expense of this remodeling work
another subscription list was passed among the congregation;
and, as usual, General Jackson&rsquo;s name headed the list. Jackson
also instilled some of his characteristic energy into the remodeling
work; and when it was suggested that a committee be appointed
to look after it he promptly and vigorously dissented,
emphatically voicing the view that responsibility for getting the
work done should be vested in one man rather than in a committee.
&ldquo;When the Lord wanted the Ark built,&rdquo; he told the astonished
elders, &ldquo;He gave the job to one man. If He had appointed
a committee to attend to it, the Ark wouldn&rsquo;t have been built yet.&rdquo;
Jackson at this time, it will be recalled, was just back from eight
years in Washington with all its red tape and circumlocutionary
delays.</p>
<p>Although a leading spirit in the building of the church and a
strict attendant at its services, Jackson was not a regularly enrolled
member until late in life. By the time the church was built
he was deeply enmeshed in politics, and he feared that any formal
religious declaration at that time would be misconstrued by his
political enemies. But, although he remained outside the fold
of the church, there is every evidence that he was deeply and sincerely
religious. He attended services regularly in Washington
while he was President, not infrequently walking alone on Sunday
morning from the White House to the Presbyterian or Episcopal
church to hear the morning sermon. He regularly paid pew
rent during his Presidential terms to both the First Presbyterian
and St. John&rsquo;s churches.</p>
<p>His private letters are replete with references to the Deity and
to the future life, and these pious references are so habitual and
so unaffected that there seems to be no reason to doubt his utmost
sincerity. In writing of his victory over Pakenham at New Orleans
he humbly attributed his triumph to the interposition of God on
his side; and while this alone might be dismissed as a mere conformity
with what might be the currently popular idea of proper
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
modesty in such matters, his letters are too strongly characterized
by expressions of his faith in an omnipotent God to leave room
for questioning his expressed convictions.</p>
<p>For instance, while in Washington in January, 1825, awaiting
the action of the House of Representatives in the election of the
President, he wrote to John Coffee: &ldquo;I am still in the habit of ascribing
the lot of man to the will of an all-wise providence, and
should I be brought into the Presidential chair it must be by His
influence counteracting the intrigues of men and the union of
interests here.&rdquo; That was no mere pious pose. He was always
frank with Coffee.</p>
<p>Nor was his religious faith of the fair-weather variety. In the
summer of 1828, during an unprecedented drouth, he wrote in
the contrite spirit of the psalmist who said: &ldquo;Though He slay me,
yet will I trust in Him:&rdquo; &ldquo;We have a very doleful prospect here.
We have not had rain enough to wet the earth one inch for three
months, every vegetable is burnt up, our cattle starving, the
springs in many places dried up, and still no prospects of rain.
The earth is so parched that we can sow no fall crop; no turnips,
no potatoes, no cabbages. Our crops of cotton and corn are only a
half crop. Still I trust in a kind Providence &lsquo;who doeth all things
well,&rsquo; that he will not scourge us with famine.&rdquo; And when, later
in the same year, that major tragedy of his life befell him in the
death of his adored wife, he met his bereavement in a similar
spirit of contrition and resignation. Writing John Coffee on January
18th, the day he left the Hermitage for Washington he said:
&ldquo;As rational beings it behooves us so to live as to be prepared for
death when it comes, with a reasonable hope of happiness hereafter
through the atonement of our blessed Saviour on the cross.&rdquo;
But later in this letter there is a poignant paragraph, where human
grief breaks through the shell of resignation, and his soul cries
out: &ldquo;My mind is so disturbed and I am even now so perplexed
with company that I can scarcely write. In short, my dear friend,
my heart is nearly broke. I try to summon up my usual fortitude,
but it is vain.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>A singular manifestation of Jackson&rsquo;s deep-seated piety is to be
found in his frequent inclination to volunteer religious admonitions
to his close friends and relatives. Soon after the death of
his wife he wrote to his brother-in-law, Captain John Donelson,
telling him that &ldquo;my dear wife had your future state much at
heart&rdquo; and urging him to &ldquo;withdraw from the busy cares of this
world and put your house in order for the next.&rdquo; Early in 1828 he
had written to John Coffee to say: &ldquo;Mrs. Jackson has rejoiced
greatly on hearing that Polly has joined the church. I rejoice also.
It is what we all ought to do, but men in public business has too
much on their minds to conform to the rules of the church, which
has prevented me hitherto.&rdquo; Similar evidences of his concern for
the piety of his friends and connections continually crop up in his
letters.</p>
<p>Rachel, who was profoundly&mdash;almost fanatically&mdash;religious,
had the General&rsquo;s spiritual well-being much at heart; and when
the little meeting-house was built he gave her his solemn promise
that as soon as he was out of politics he would make a public
declaration of his faith and ally himself with the church. He was
reminded of his promise in 1838, after he had returned to the
Hermitage from Washington, at which time he said: &ldquo;I would
long since have made this solemn public dedication to Almighty
God, but knowing the wretchedness of this world and how prone
many are to evil, that the scoffer of religion would have cried out
&lsquo;Hypocrisy! he has joined the church for political effect,&rsquo; I
thought it best to postpone this public act until my retirement to
the shades of private life, when no false imputation could be made
that might be injurious to religion.&rdquo; The records of the church
show, however, that promptly upon his return to private life in
1837 he took the step of public declaration of faith, following a
&ldquo;protracted meeting&rdquo; at the Hermitage church. His son&rsquo;s wife
joined the church at the same time and Parton thus describes the
scene:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hermitage church was crowded to the utmost of its small
capacity; the very windows were darkened with the eager faces
of the servants. After the usual services, the General rose to make
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
the required public declaration of his concurrence with the doctrines,
and his resolve to obey the precepts, of the church. He
leaned heavily upon his stick with both hands; tears rolled down
his cheeks. His daughter, the fair, young matron, stood beside
him. Amid a silence the most profound, the General answered the
questions proposed to him. When he was formally pronounced a
member of the church, and the clergyman was about to continue
the services, the long restrained feeling of the congregation burst
forth in sobs and exclamations, which compelled him to pause
for several minutes. The clergyman himself was speechless with
emotion, and abandoned himself to the exultation of the hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joining the church is not usually an intricate or difficult process,
but in General Jackson&rsquo;s case an unexpected obstacle arose when
Dr. Edgar (the minister in charge of the proceedings and, incidentally
a pronounced Whig in his political views) asked the
prospective church member: &ldquo;Can you forgive all your enemies?&rdquo;
This unexpected question was a poser for a man like General
Jackson, a strong personality who made staunch friends and violent
enemies. We can picture his memory flashing back through
the long roster of his antagonists: Dickinson and Clay and Adams
and Calhoun&mdash;he had lived a long life and it was a sizable list.
There must have been a painful pause before he answered the
minister&rsquo;s question. Jackson was a sincere man at heart and undoubtedly
wanted to be honest with himself and with his God.
At length he replied: &ldquo;My political enemies I can freely forgive;
but as for those who abused me when I was serving my country in
the field, and those who attacked me for serving my country&mdash;Doctor,
that is a different case.&rdquo; Doctor Edgar, however, insisted
that forgiveness of all enemies was a fundamental and indispensable
condition of reception into the Christian faith. So the candidate
for membership in the church gave himself over to another
period of reflection and at length stated that &ldquo;he thought he could
forgive all who injured him,&rdquo; even those who had criticised him
while he was in the field; and upon this rather equivocal assurance
the ceremonies proceeded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>The General&rsquo;s conversion, in connection with the protracted
meeting, served to breathe new breath into the little church at the
Hermitage, which had been having a struggle for life after the
death of Mrs. Jackson and the General&rsquo;s absence of eight years in
Washington. Now the church began actively to function again,
and its new and distinguished convert was promptly nominated
a &ldquo;ruling elder.&rdquo; But he declined the nomination. &ldquo;My countrymen
have given me high honors,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I should esteem the
office of ruling elder in the church of Christ a far higher honor
than any I have ever received. But I am too young in the church
for such an office. The Bible says &lsquo;Be not hasty in laying on of
hands.&rsquo;&rdquo; And then he nominated two elderly neighbors as elders.</p>
<p>Jackson, however, despite his unwillingness to hold office in
the church, entered actively and whole-heartedly into its work.
One of its pastors, reminiscing in later years, said that in the
winter-time, when the ground was covered with snow, it was no
unusual thing for him to arrive at the church and find no one there
but the General and his man servant. Jackson would have the
servant busy keeping up the fires in the two fireplaces and making
preparations so that the rest of the congregation would be comfortable
when they arrived. No matter how bad the weather, his
attendance at services could be counted on; and he was particularly
punctilious about attending on Communion Sundays, always
advancing to the Communion table on the arm of his daughter-in-law.</p>
<p>The Hermitage church was dedicated by Dr. William Hume,
one of the famous figures in the Presbyterian ministry in the
South. Other distinguished divines have occupied the pulpit during
the years since then; and on one occasion a &ldquo;mysterious
stranger&rdquo; appeared and volunteered to preach and did so for
three months before he disappeared as suddenly and mysteriously
as he came, it being discovered later that he was a convict escaped
from a Northern prison. Another volunteer preacher appeared
one Sunday and delivered a sermon, a conspicuous feature of his
performance being that he refused to preach from the pulpit, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
talked from behind a table placed in the aisle. A short while after
he left Jesse James was killed in Missouri, and a tradition sprang
up that the mysterious preacher was none other than the redoubtable
outlaw, a color of plausibility being lent this legend by the
fact that the James brothers used Nashville as a hide-out during
their days of outlawry.</p>
<p class="tb">References to Jackson&rsquo;s religious views and his church affiliations
may seem discordant with the familiar picture of a swearing,
gambling, brawling frontiersman; but the rough, free-and-easy
side of Jackson&rsquo;s life has been somewhat over-emphasized
in popular history to the exclusion of the gentler side of his character.</p>
<p>General Jackson, despite popular beliefs to the contrary, had a
deeply-rooted religious background and a strongly developed
sense of reverence. He was taught the scripture by his mother
when a boy, and was made familiar with the stern old Westminster
Catechism before her death. At the time he was a judge
in Tennessee, while still a young man, he was known to entertain
strongly religious views. One who knew him then states that
&ldquo;Judge Jackson freely and frequently averred his full and unwavering
confidence in the divine authority of the Bible and the
truth of the gospel declaration that Jesus Christ is the only Saviour
of lost men, and that we must repent of sin and obey the gospel
of Christ or our souls can not be saved.&rdquo; A 100% Fundamentalist!
Jackson himself stated, in commenting on some of the unfounded
criticism of him during the 1828 campaign, that for 35 years
before his election to the Presidency he never failed to read at
least three chapters of the Bible every day.</p>
<p>This side of Jackson&rsquo;s character, however, it must be admitted,
was not generally known; and when he joined the church it attracted
attention all over the country. A prominent citizen of
Missouri, writing about it at the time, said: &ldquo;In my early days the
palpable and notorious infidelity of Thomas Jefferson spread a
desolation that was mournful over the entire face of the western
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
country. The enemies of religion took courage and threw up their
blasphemy in the face of heaven. But now here is a man, raised up
by the hand of God to the possession of an influence far beyond
all that Jefferson ever possessed, for Jefferson never was able to
wield public opinion in this great nation as General Jackson has
done; and yet this man publicly prostrates himself before the
cross and calls on the crucified Redeemer as his Lord and his God.
The American church should not suffer this important testimony
of General Jackson to be overlooked or forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson was a consistent church-goer all his life, even before he
contributed so much of his influence and means to the establishment
of the Hermitage church; and an amusing episode, and one
typical of the times, took place in October, 1818, when the Reverend
Peter Cartright, the famous backwoods preacher, was holding
services in a Methodist church in Nashville, preaching on the
text: &ldquo;What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and
lose his own soul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Parson Cartright, who was a sort of pioneer Billy Sunday, had
hardly more than announced his text than General Jackson entered
the church and stood for a moment in the aisle looking for a
seat. The resident minister seated behind the Reverend Cartright
pulled at his coat-tails and said in a stage whisper: &ldquo;General
Jackson has come in! General Jackson has come in!&rdquo; This interruption
aroused the indignation of the fiery parson and so he retorted
in a voice loud enough to be heard by all: &ldquo;Who is General
Jackson? If he don&rsquo;t get his soul converted, God will damn him
as quick as he would a Guinea nigger!&rdquo; General Jackson, so it is
told, joined in the mirth aroused by this spirited retort (a near-blasphemy
in those days of Jackson&rsquo;s transcendent popularity),
and the preaching proceeded without further untoward incident.
But the pastor of the church was fearful that the General might
have been offended by the outspoken visiting clergyman, and he
set out early the next morning to make an apology for the incident.
It happened, however, that General Jackson met Mr. Cartright
on the street face to face that morning and, reaching out his hand,
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
said: &ldquo;Mr. Cartright, you are a man after my own heart. I am very
much surprised at Mr. Mac (the local pastor) to think he would
suppose that I would be offended at you. No, sir, I told him that
I highly approved of your independence; that a minister of Jesus
Christ ought to love everybody and fear no mortal man. I told
him that if I had a few thousand such fearless, independent officers
as you were, and a well-drilled army, I could take old England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This episode comes down to us in Parson Cartright&rsquo;s own
memoirs, and it may be that it has gained something in the telling.
It does not, however, appear out of character for either of them.
Mr. Cartright was the kind of man who would not hesitate to say
what he thought, in the pulpit or out; and Jackson was an admirer
of spunk wherever he found it. The parson&rsquo;s credibility, however,
is somewhat damaged by another Jackson anecdote he tells.</p>
<p>Mr. Cartright, according to this story, had preached one day
near the Hermitage and had been invited to dine with the General.
As usual the Hermitage was full of company, including a
young lawyer from Nashville who was enjoying the attention he
was attracting by declaring himself an infidel. The parson endeavored
not to be drawn into a theological discussion with the
young man, but the latter was determined to have a dispute with
him and said: &ldquo;Mr. Cartright, do you really believe there is any
such place as hell, as a place of torment?&rdquo; The parson replied in
the affirmative, whereupon the lawyer said: &ldquo;Well I thank God I
have too much good sense to believe any such thing.&rdquo; Before Mr.
Cartright could reply, so he relates, General Jackson interrupted
to say: &ldquo;Well, sir, I thank God there is such a place of torment as
hell;&rdquo; and when the surprised young man asked him why, he went
on. &ldquo;To put in it such damned rascals as you, that oppose and
villify the Christian religion!&rdquo; It is hard to believe that General
Jackson would ever speak thus brusquely to a guest in his home;
but, anyhow, it makes a good story.</p>
<p>Although he would not join the church while he was actively
in politics, Jackson was shrewd enough to know that a man in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
public eye must carefully watch his personal conduct and avoid
even the appearance of evil. So, despite his known fondness for
the current sports of the frontier while he was a young man, after
he became a statesman he was most punctilious about his conduct.
In 1824, while a candidate for President, he sat down and wrote
out a specific and categorical denial of various campaign charges,
in the course of which he said: &ldquo;It is a positive falsehood that
General Jackson has been either at a cockfight or sports of a
similar nature for the last thirteen years,&rdquo; and then entered into a
detailed disclaimer of any sympathy with or actively in the &ldquo;wild&rdquo;
activities of the day.</p>
<p>He was at this time especially careful of his reputation in connection
with the breeding and racing of thoroughbred horses.
There was then, as now, a nice social distinction between the
stock breeder and the man who operates a string of race horses on
the tracks; and although Jackson in his youth was not above riding
his own horse in a race in an emergency, when he became
President he wanted it distinctly understood that he was primarily
the owner of a stock farm and that he had no part nor parcel in
their actual racing or training.</p>
<p>There was an amusing example of this hair-splitting distinction
during his first Presidential term. His correspondence with his
adopted son and with his overseer, early in 1832, indicated that
the current crop of colts was very promising, and Andrew, junior,
was planning to enter one of them in the sweepstakes in the East.
The colts, in charge of the grooms, had actually been started on
their way to the East for preliminary training when the adopted
son, apparently inspired by the irrepressible young Hutchings,
sent after them and had them returned to the Hermitage for training
on the private track there. The old General suspected that
Hutchings was also having his own colt trained there, and he
wrote his son a sharp letter expressing astonishment at his &ldquo;unaccountable
conduct.&rdquo; Hutchings and Steele (the overseer), he
wrote, knew very well that he was opposed to having any horses
trained on the track on his plantation. &ldquo;It might have been construed
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
that I was encouraging racing,&rdquo; he said virtuously, pointing
out that such a criticism could not justly be made of him
when he was giving the colts to his son and Hutchings &ldquo;and having
them sent away and run elsewhere.&rdquo; So incensed did the General
become at the possibility of having his position misunderstood
(although, at this writing, it seems to have been equivocal
to say the least of it) that he instructed his son to &ldquo;Have the turf
closed, plowed up, and permit not a horse to be galloped upon
it.&rdquo; It appears that no such drastic action was taken; but it is
plain to see that Jackson had a very exalted idea of the position
he held and a keen understanding of the desirability of keeping
the occupant of the President&rsquo;s chair entirely disassociated with
the sordid business of horse racing.</p>
<p>This very appreciation of the political value of a reputation for
piety renders all the more admirable his firm determination not
to join the church during his active days in politics when it might
have been suspected that he was using membership in the church
for political effect. General Jackson had his faults and he had his
share of the vices of the day; but he was not a hypocrite. Fundamentally
he was a firm believer in the tenets of the Christian religion,
but so long as he felt any question as to his ability to adhere
strictly to the creed of the church without in any way drawing
discredit on it or attracting suspicion to his motives, just so long
did he choose to follow his religious beliefs outside the fold.</p>
<p>Although he had been slow about joining the church, Jackson
enjoyed his association with it during his declining years and was
a regular attendant at its services, joining lustily in the singing of
his favorite hymns and listening attentively to the expounding of
the gospel. But at last there came a day when he was no longer
physically able to make even the short journey from the Hermitage
to the little church down the road. The multiplied infirmities
of old age at last forced him to capitulate.</p>
<p>It is a fact not sufficiently emphasized in most of the published
biographies of Andrew Jackson that during almost his entire life
he was in bad health&mdash;not merely debilitated, but actually tortured
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
with pain. His constitution, never particularly robust, was
undermined by the grueling hardships of the early campaigns
against the Indians from which he returned afflicted with chronic
dysentery. Throughout his life he was a victim of severe, nerve-racking
headaches, of which there is passing mention in many of
his letters. During his last years he fell a victim of tuberculosis
which, according to one of his biographers, entirely destroyed one
of his lungs; and, as though that were not sufficient bodily ailments,
dropsy attacked him during the last six months of his life
and caused him such agony as to make his existence a burden to
him. He had been dangerously wounded with pistol balls twice&mdash;in
his duel with Dickinson and his brawl with the Bentons&mdash;and
from the effects of these wounds he never entirely recovered.
He was confined to his room in the White House during almost
the whole of his last four months of his administration, and during
that time he suffered a hemorrhage of the lungs so severe
that attending physicians despaired of his life. He rallied all his
strength and bravely rode to the inauguration with his successor,
Martin Van Buren; but he returned to the Hermitage in 1837 a
broken-down and seriously ill old man. At the time he frankly expressed
doubt whether he would long survive; but the return
home exerted a beneficial influence on his health, and he improved
to such an extent that it was eight years before the end came.</p>
<p>During this entire eight-year span, up almost to the very moment
of his death, he never relaxed his active interest and participation
in public affairs. Tennessee&rsquo;s gubernatorial campaign of
1838 almost immediately engaged his attention, and he worked
with all that was left of his old-time energy to elect his newest
political protege, James K. Polk. Following the election all the
Democratic big-wigs of Tennessee, including Jackson and Felix
Grundy, repaired to Tyree Springs for a vacation and celebration
of Polk&rsquo;s victory.</p>
<p>Again in 1840, despite his age and the enfeebled state of his
health, he left the quiet shades of the Hermitage and went on an
ill-advised stump-speaking trip through West Tennessee in support
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
of Martin Van Buren who had been re-nominated for the
Presidency by the Democrats. It was a bitter blow to the old man
when, in spite of his active support of his favorite, the Whigs
carried Tennessee for Harrison by a majority of more than 12,000
votes; but he accepted the blow philosophically, stating that his
belief in the soundness of the republic was so great that he felt
that it would survive even the terrible experience of four years
under Harrison&rsquo;s rule.</p>
<p>Jackson conscientiously believed that Harrison was unfitted
for the Presidency&mdash;so much so that he frankly expressed the belief
that Harrison&rsquo;s early death was a direct interposition of God
to save the country from misrule. The Democratic defeat of 1840
only served to stimulate the old General to extra efforts to retrieve
the loss in 1844. The selection of a standard bearer in this campaign
was the subject of much intra-party deliberation and negotiation.
General Jackson favored James K. Polk, and he was finally
made the nominee. The General, although now 77 years old,
buckled on his armor and actively engaged himself in the campaign
for his young fellow Tennesseean. Too old and ill to take
the stump again he resorted to a ceaseless campaign of letter writing,
and the work he did from the Hermitage was largely instrumental
in placing the relatively unknown Polk in the White
House.</p>
<p>So elated was he at the success of his hand-picked candidate
that he gave a stupendous garden party and barbecue at the Hermitage
in celebration of Polk&rsquo;s election; and in the afternoon
he tottered out on the upstairs portico and, leaning over the railing,
harangued his several hundred guests with an old-time, fiery
political speech. It was a gala occasion.</p>
<p>He took an intense interest in the developments of Polk&rsquo;s administration,
particularly the annexation of Texas, and he followed
this closely through correspondence with his old friend,
Sam Houston, and with Andrew Jackson Donelson who was then
representing the United States in the Republic of Texas. Houston
visited the Hermitage during this period, and on one of these
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
visits Jackson entertained with a big dinner at which the piece de
resistance was a haunch of bear meat. Some admirer of the General&rsquo;s
in Arkansas had sent him a live bear cub as a token of his
esteem, and for a while the animal was kept on the front lawn of
the Hermitage tied to one of the big holly trees. When Houston
came to town Jackson decided that the bear should be a sacrifice
to the distinguished visitor, and so the political leaders and neighbors
were invited to come and partake of the bear-meat dinner.</p>
<p>These closing years of the old statesman&rsquo;s life were complicated
by the stream of visitors at the Hermitage&mdash;office seekers
and hero worshipers. The General tried to see them all, even up
to the last few weeks before his death, lying propped up on a sofa
in his room, with a black boy fanning him with a bush to keep
the flies away. Patiently he received them: wrote his name in autograph
albums, patted the heads of small boys brought to look on
his countenance, heard the pleas of those seeking his support in
their efforts to get political appointments. Generally he was
patient; but, on at least one occasion, he blurted out: &ldquo;I am dying
as fast as I can and they all know it; but they will keep swarming
upon me in crowds, seeking for office&mdash;intriguing for office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One distinguished visitor of this period was G. P. A. Healy,
the celebrated artist commissioned by Louis Phillipe to paint a
portrait of Jackson to hang beside that of Washington in the
king&rsquo;s gallery at Paris. The story of Healy&rsquo;s arrival at the Hermitage
is a dramatic one. Arriving unannounced at the house, he
found no one there but the desperately ill old man and the servants.
Ushered into Jackson&rsquo;s room, where he was sitting propped
up in his big chair by the window, Healy, impressed by the fame
of the distinguished citizen in whose presence he stood, fell on his
knee before him and exclaimed: &ldquo;I have come to paint your picture.&rdquo;
This obsequiousness did not suit the old democrat, and he
sternly bade him to rise, saying: &ldquo;Kneel to no one but your
Maker!&rdquo; Healy apparently did not succeed in making himself
clear as to his purpose, and so he returned to Nashville where he
found Andrew, junior, and his wife, explained his intentions to
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
them and returned to the Hermitage with them. Then General
Jackson would not consent to sit for his picture unless young Mrs.
Jackson would pose also. She consented, and so Healy fell to
work. He succeeded in his race with Death, completing the
portrait just ten days before the old man gave up the ghost; and
the portrait made under these trying circumstances (of which a
duplicate made by Healy now hangs in the Hermitage) is considered
a good likeness and an excellent piece of work.</p>
<p>The Healy portrait, however, good as it is, can hardly be considered
a better likeness than one other picture made during these
last days of the General&rsquo;s life&mdash;a daguerreotype made by a Nashville
man, Dan Adams, who had lately become a practitioner of
the newly discovered art. To gratify the ambition of Mr. Adams
to hand down to posterity an actual likeness of General Jackson,
the sick old man was carried in his chair out onto the back porch
and there the exposure was made. It is a tradition in the family
that the General was displeased with the likeness when it was
shown to him, expressing his disapproval of it in characteristic
language; but it is entirely likely that this is, in fact, the most
faithful image of Andrew Jackson that now exists, even though
the pain-wracked old man growled when they showed it to him:
&ldquo;Humph! Looks like a monkey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only was the master of the Hermitage persecuted by
visitors during his last eight years, but during this time he was
also bombarded with correspondence pouring in on him from
friends and strangers, persons seeking political favors, inviting
him to celebrations and barbecues, asking for autographs or locks
of his hair, or merely expressing their admiration. A recent article
in a New York paper reproduced a letter from one of the impressionable
young ladies of 1842 who wanted a lock of the old hero&rsquo;s
hair, and this letter is fairly typical of those that poured in on him.
After a florid and flattering introductory paragraph the young
lady says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To behold the hoary head and time-honored frame of one who
fearlessly bared his breast to the shafts of the enemy of his country,
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
both in time of peace as well as in war&mdash;to clasp his hand, to
receive a blessing from his lips&mdash;would be a delight which nothing
on earth could equal. But this joy I dare not hope to experience.
I trust you will pardon the liberty I take in the request which
I am about to make. Do not refuse to make a young heart happy.
A few months ago I saw in a newspaper an account of a visit of
some young people to whom you gave some locks of your hair. I
read my Bible every night and morning and endeavor to follow
the precepts contained in that sacred volume. It warns me of the
sin and danger of envy and uncharitableness. But I confess to you
that ever since reading that account I have envied those young
countrymen of mine. As you are the cause of this sorrow and sadness,
so does the cure rest with you. The struggle has been great
ere I could summon courage to address you, but may I not supplicate
for a similar favor? This gift will be more precious to me
than threads of fine gold. I shall prize it through life as my
choicest earthly possession, and when the hour of death comes and
I must surrender my spirit into the hands of Him who gave it, I
shall bequeath this lock of hair to the one whom my heart shall
then prize most.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, after a fulsome concluding paragraph, the young lady
signs her name &ldquo;with sentiments of gratitude and affection too
deep for utterance.&rdquo; And on the back of this gushing epistle Old
Hickory has laconically endorsed: &ldquo;Answered and returned a
lock of my hair, this 28th of October, 1842.&mdash;A.J.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This flowery application for a lock of the Jacksonian hair was
by no means an isolated or unusual request. In fact, so insistent
was the demand that the General formed the habit of carefully
saving for this purpose the trimmings whenever he had his hair
cut, and out of this little bag of hoarded locks came the souvenirs
sent to correspondents and presented to admiring visitors.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * *</span></p>
<p>But, despite his wonderful vitality and determined resistance
to the inroads of disease; the sands of the old man&rsquo;s life were
running out their allotted time. It was on a quiet Sunday in June
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
that the summons came for him. The end was not unexpected,
either by him or by the household. Two Sundays before he had
partaken of the Communion, and had taken that occasion to
speak feelingly on the consolation of religion and to declare that
he was ready to go. &ldquo;Death,&rdquo; he said stoutly, &ldquo;has no terrors for
me.&rdquo; And this was doubtless no mere figure of speech after the
suffering he experienced during the last four months of his life,
during which time he found it impossible to lie down in bed unless
lulled by opiates.</p>
<p>Sunday morning he was lifted from his bed and placed in his
big chair by the window. The warm June sun was sifting down
onto the Hermitage lawn through the sheltering cedars and hollies.
The diseased-wracked old man, as he looked out on the scene
he loved so well, doubtless sensed that it was close to the last time
he would ever see it. Dr. Esselman when he entered the room that
morning, to use his own words, &ldquo;immediately perceived that the
hand of death was upon him.&rdquo; Andrew, junior, was notified that
the end was at hand, and a messenger was sent for Major Lewis
whom Jackson had expressed a wish to have by his side when
death approached. A servant was dispatched post-haste to the
church to recall the children of the household who were attending
Sunday School. The sad news traveled quickly over the plantation
and the servants gathered on the broad front porch, fearfully
looking in at the windows.</p>
<p>The old General maintained his consciousness to the very end.
When his old crony, Major Lewis, arrived he greeted him with:
&ldquo;Major, I am glad to see you. You like to have been too late,&rdquo; and
then carefully and methodically he gave him messages to some of
his closest friends, like Colonel Benton and General Houston,
who were unable to be at his bedside. Sadly but calmly he bade
farewell to each member of the family, and mustered his failing
strength to speak a kindly word of comfort to the weeping and
wailing servants whose tear-stained black faces darkened the
front windows. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; he said gently to them, &ldquo;Be good and
we shall meet&mdash;&rdquo; And then, with just a little gasp to mark its
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
passing, his unconquerable spirit left his frail body. His little
granddaughter, Rachel, was standing at the foot of his bed, her
hand on the covering, and she felt the tremor that passed over his
body as he expired.</p>
<p>General Jackson had expressed the wish that his funeral services
be simple and without pomp or ostentation; but such a funeral
was hardly possible for the most distinguished private citizen
of his day. The military company marched out from Nashville to
attend the services, held two days later, and accompanied his
body to the grave; and a great multitude of people, estimated at
three thousand, gathered to pay their last tribute. The funeral
was preached by Dr. Edgar, the minister who had received him
into the church, the services being conducted from the front
porch owing to the inability of the large crowd to get inside the
house.</p>
<p>There was a moment of disturbance while the mourners were
assembling, caused by an untimely outburst of blistering profanity
from old Poll, the Hermitage parrot who had so long been a favorite
pet of the General&rsquo;s. The solemnity of the occasion was completely
upset by the sudden torrent of objurgation from the old
bird on her perch on the upper front gallery, but she was quickly
banished to the servants&rsquo; quarters at the back of the house and Dr.
Edgar stepped out on the stone-paved portico and began to read
the burial service.</p>
<p>The General&rsquo;s favorite hymns were sung; a prayer was said.
The casket was taken from its place in the great hall and carried
to the tomb awaiting him in the garden by Rachel&rsquo;s side. A firing
squad raised their muskets and a military salute shattered the hush
of the warm summer morning. The smoke from the guns floated
upward through the heavy foliage of the overhanging magnolias;
the military company formed in ranks and briskly marched off;
the crowd dispersed; the sorrowing family walked slowly back up
the garden path to the house; a cloud of dust rose over the road
as the carriages of the notable citizens of Nashville started back to
town.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>Andrew Jackson, after a tempestuous life of 77 years, was at rest
by the side of her of whom he had said: &ldquo;Heaven will be no
heaven for me if she is not there.&rdquo; No more would his vivid personality
leave its impress on public affairs. No more would the
parlors&rsquo; walls re&euml;cho his shrill voice as he sang &ldquo;Auld Lang
Syne.&rdquo; No more would a crowd of guests about the big table in
the dining room listen attentively as he told of some incident of
the wars. No more would the papers on his office desk rattle as he
crashed down his fist and stormed &ldquo;No! by the Eternal!&rdquo; The
spark of his existence, which made the Hermitage a beacon of
democracy, was extinguished.</p>
<p class="tb">He has been gone now for nearly a century; his body still rests
in the stone vault in the garden where loving hands placed it that
hot June day in 1845. But, somehow, it is impossible to visit the
Hermitage today, standing just as it was when he left it, without
experiencing a mysterious feeling of his presence in the old house.
Maintained though it is as a public shrine, the visitor when crossing
the threshold has the sensation of entering into a living home;
and it requires but little sense of the mystic to feel that he might
look up and see the tall, angular form of the General come slowly
down the sweeping circular stairway to greet the wayfaring guest.</p>
<p>Throughout the life of Andrew Jackson he was like a part of
the old house which held so large a place in his heart; and today it
is as though that part of him had never died. Indefinably it seems
as though some elusive fragment of the spirit of Old Hickory is
still there; and few of those who come there go away without
experiencing that feeling of inspiration which arises from close
contact with the deathless spirit of a great man.</p>

<h2 id="c11">APPENDIX B: ANDREW JACKSON&rsquo;S WILL</h2>
<p><span class="lr">Hermitage, June 7th, 1843</span></p>
<p>IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN:&mdash;I, Andrew Jackson, Sr., being
of sound mind, memory and understanding, and impressed with the
great uncertainty of life and the certainty of death, and being desirous to
dispose of my temporal affairs so that after my death no contention may
arise relative to the same; and whereas, since executing my will of the
30th of September, 1833, my estate has become greatly involved by my
liabilities for the debts of my well-beloved and adopted son, Andrew
Jackson, Jr., which makes it necessary to alter the same: Therefore I,
Andrew Jackson, Sr., of the County of Davidson and State of Tennessee
do make, ordain, publish and declare this my last will and testament,
revoking all other wills by me heretofore made.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, I bequeath my body to the dust whence it comes, and my soul to
God who gave it, hoping for a happy immortality through the atoning
merits of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. My desire is
that my body be buried by the side of my dear departed wife, in the
garden at the Hermitage, in the vault prepared in the garden, and all
expenses paid by my executor hereafter named.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>, That all my just debts be paid out of my personal and real
estate by my executor; for which purpose, to meet the debt of my good
friends General J. B. Blanchin &amp; Co., of New Orleans, for the sum of
six thousand dollars, with the interest accruing thereon, loaned to me
to meet the debt due by A. Jackson, Jr., for the purchase of the plantation
from Hiram G. Runnels, lying on the east bank of the river Mississippi,
in the State of Mississippi; also, a debt due by me of ten thousand dollars,
borrowed of my friends Blair and Rives, of the city of Washington
and District of Columbia, with the interest accruing thereon, being applied
to the payment of the lands bought of Hiram G. Runnels as aforesaid;
and for the faithful payment of the aforesaid recited debts, I hereby
bequeath all my real and personal estate. After these debts are fully paid,</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>, I give and bequeath to my adopted son, Andrew Jackson,
Jr., the tract of land whereon I now live, known as the Hermitage tract,
with its butts and boundaries, with all its appendages of the three lots
of land bought of Samuel Donelson, Thomas J. Donelson and Alexander
Donelson, sons and heirs of Savern Donelson, deceased, all adjoining
the Hermitage tract, agreeable to their butts and boundaries, with all the
appurtenances thereto belonging or in any wise appertaining, with all
my negroes that I may die possessed of, with the exceptions hereafter
named, with all their increase after the before recited debts are fully
paid, with all the household furniture, farming tools, stock of all kind,
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
both on the Hermitage tract farms, as well as those on the Mississippi
plantation, to him and his heirs, forever. The true intent and meaning
of this may last will and testament is, that all my estate, real, personal
and mixed, is hereby bequeathed to my adopted son A. Jackson, Jr., with
the exceptions hereafter named, to him and his heirs, forever.</p>
<p><i>Fourth</i>, Whereas I have heretofore by conveyance, deposited with my
beloved daughter, Sarah Jackson, wife of my adopted son, A. Jackson,
Jr., given to my beloved granddaughter, Rachel Jackson, daughter of A.
Jackson, Jr. and Sarah his wife, several negroes therein described, which
I hereby confirm&mdash;I give and bequeath to my beloved grandson, Andrew
Jackson, son of A. Jackson, Jr. and Sarah his wife, a negro boy named
Ned, son of Blacksmith Aaron and Hannah his wife, to him and his
heirs forever.</p>
<p><i>Fifth</i>, I give and bequeath to my beloved little grandson, Samuel
Jackson, son of A. Jackson, Jr. and his much beloved wife Sarah, one
negro boy named Davy or George, son of Squire and his wife Giney, to
him and his heirs forever.</p>
<p><i>Sixth</i>, To my beloved and affectionate daughter, Sarah Jackson, wife
of my adopted and well beloved son, A. Jackson, Jr., I hereby recognize
by this bequest the gift I made her on her marriage, of the negro girl
Gracy, which I bought for her, and gave her to my daughter Sarah as her
maid and seamstress, with her increase, with my house-servant Hannah
and her two daughters, namely Charlotte and Mary, to her and her heirs
forever. This gift and bequest is made for my great affection to her&mdash;as
a memento of her uniform attention to me and kindness on all occasions,
and particularly when worn down with sickness, pain and debility. She
has been more than a daughter to me, and I hope she never will be disturbed
in the enjoyment of this gift and bequest by any one.</p>
<p><i>Seventh</i>, I bequeath to my well beloved nephew, Andrew J. Donelson,
son of Samuel Donelson, deceased, the elegant sword presented to me
by the State of Tennessee, with this injunction, that he fail not to use it
when necessary in support and protection of our glorious union, and for
the protection of the constitutional rights of our beloved country, should
they be assailed by foreign enemies or domestic traitors. This, from the
great change in my worldly affairs of late, is, with my blessing, all I can
bequeath him, doing justice to those creditors to whom I am responsible.
This bequest is made as a memento of the high regard, affection and
esteem I bear for him, as a high-minded, honest and honorable man.</p>
<p><i>Eighth</i>, To my grand-nephew, Andrew Jackson Coffee, I bequeath the
elegant sword presented to me by the Rifle Company of New Orleans,
commanded by Captain Beal, as a memento of my regard, and to bring
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
to his recollection the gallant services of his deceased father, General
John Coffee, in the late Indian and British war, under my command, and
his gallant conduct in defense of New Orleans in 1814 and 1815, with
this injunction: that he wield it in protection of the rights secured to
the American citizens under our glorious constitution, against all invaders,
whether foreign foes or intestine traitors.</p>
<p>I bequeath to my beloved grandson, Andrew Jackson, son of A.
Jackson, Jr., and Sarah his wife, the sword presented to me by the citizens
of Philadelphia, with his injunction: that he will always use it in the defense
of the constitution and our glorious union, and the perpetuation of
our republican system: remembering the motto&mdash;&ldquo;Draw me not without
occasion, nor sheath me without honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pistols of General Lafayette, which were presented by him to
General George Washington, and by Colonel William Robertson presented
to me, I bequeath to George Washington Lafayette, as a memento
of the illustrious personages through whose hands they have
passed&mdash;<i>his father, and the father of his country</i>.</p>
<p>The gold box presented to me by the corporation of the city of New
York, the large silver vase presented to me by the ladies of Charleston,
South Carolina, my native state, with the large picture representing the
unfurling of the American banner, presented to me by the citizens of
South Carolina, when it was refused to be accepted by the United States
Senate, I leave in trust to my son A. Jackson, Jr. with instructions that
should our happy country not be blessed with peace, an event not always
to be expected, he will, at the close of the war or end of the conflict,
present each of said articles of inestimable value to that patriot, residing
in the city or state from which they were presented, who shall be adjudged
by his countrymen or the ladies to have been the most valiant in
defense of his country and our country&rsquo;s rights.</p>
<p>The pocket spyglass which was used by General Washington during
the revolutionary war, and presented to me by Mr. Custis, having been
burned with my dwelling-house, the Hermitage, with many other invaluable
relics, I can make no disposition of them. As a memento of my
high regard for General Robert Armstrong, as a gentleman, patriot and
soldier, as well as for his meritorious military services under my command
during the late British and Indian war, and remembering the gallant
bearing of him and his gallant little band at Enotochopco creek,
when, falling desperately wounded, he called out &ldquo;My brave fellows,
some may fall, but save the cannon&rdquo;&mdash;as a memento of all these things,
I give and bequeath to him my case of pistols and sword worn by me
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
throughout my military career, well satisfied that in his hands they will
never be disgraced&mdash;that they will never be used or drawn without occasion,
nor sheathed but with honor.</p>
<p><i>Lastly</i>, I leave to my beloved son all my walking-canes and other
relics, to be distributed among my young relatives&mdash;namesakes&mdash;first,
to my much esteemed namesake, Andrew J. Donelson, son of my
esteemed nephew, A. J. Donelson, his first choice, and then to be distributed
as A. Jackson, Jr., may think proper.</p>
<p><i>Lastly</i>, I appoint my adopted son, Andrew Jackson, Jr., my whole and
sole executor to this my last will and testament, and direct that no security
be required of him for the faithful execution and discharge of the
trusts hereby reposed in him.</p>
<p>In testimony whereof I have this 7th day of June, one thousand eight
hundred and forty-three, hereunto set my hand, and affixed my seal,
hereby revoking all wills heretofore made by me, and in the presence of</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>Marion Adams,</dt>
<dt>Elizabeth D. Love,</dt>
<dt>Thos. J. Donelson,</dt>
<dt>Richard Smith,</dt>
<dt>R. Armstrong,</dt></dl>
<p><span class="lr">ANDREW JACKSON (Seal)</span></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<h2 id="c12">APPENDIX C: HIS GOINGS AND COMINGS</h2>
<p>Andrew Jackson, unfortunately, did not keep a journal or diary and
thus leave behind him a record of his movements from day to day; but
from the extensive files of his correspondence it is possible to patch together
an accurate record of his goings and comings after he started living
at the Hermitage.</p>
<p>Jackson was essentially a home-loving man; his letters are full of unmistakably
sincere evidences of it. But in spite of his dislike for being
away from home, he did a powerful lot of traveling from time to time.
In February, 1822, Mrs. Jackson wrote: &ldquo;In the thirty years of our
wedded life ... he has not spent one-fourth of his days under his own
roof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s first notable absence from home after he moved to the Hermitage
was when on that bright May day in 1806 he kissed Rachel goodbye
and, together with his seconds, rode soberly off to the rendezvous
across the Kentucky line where he was to meet Mr. Charles Dickinson,
the gay young Nashville blade who had signed his death warrant by provoking
a duel with the up-and-coming young lawyer. Dickinson was a
famous crack shot, and when Jackson rode away from home that morning
he had every reason to fear that he would never see the Hermitage again.
But two days later his friends brought him home&mdash;alive but severely,
almost fatally, wounded. Rachel fluttered over him and nursed him back
to health, gladdened by his safe return though saddened by the tragic
outcome of the affray.</p>
<p>It was not until 1813 that Jackson, now a major general of militia,
left home to head the abortive expedition of the Tennessee militia and
volunteers to Natchez in the early stages of the War of 1812. As a result
of either a stupid blunder or a malicious conspiracy (Jackson naturally
believed the latter) his troops were ordered by the Secretary of War to
be discharged at Natchez&mdash;500 miles from home. But Jackson, with
characteristic fire and steadfastness, defied the Secretary and insisted on
marching his men back up the Natchez Trace to Tennessee so that they
could be mustered out at home. It was on this painful homeward march
that he shared the privations of his men with such fortitude that he
gained the everlasting nickname of Old Hickory; and this was his first
step up the ladder of fame. He left the Hermitage in January a commonplace
backwoods militia officer; he came back in April a hero.</p>
<p>He was to stay at home but a few months, it developed, but during
that time he managed to disable himself by getting involved in an inexcusable
knock-down-and-drag-out fight with Tom and Jesse Benton
from which he emerged with a nasty wound in his shoulder which was
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
exasperatingly slow about healing. He was at home in bed when the
summons came in October from Governor Blount to call out the militia
and march to Alabama to avenge the bloody massacre of the Fort Mimms
garrison by the Creeks. His doctor at his bedside was aghast when the
Governor&rsquo;s message was read, and instantly volunteered the professional
opinion that Jackson was not physically able to lead his men in the proposed
campaign. &ldquo;The devil in hell he&rsquo;s not!&rdquo; exclaimed the wounded
General as he crawled out of bed and called for his uniform. And he did
forthwith proceed with his duties as commanding officer of the militia-men,
although he frequently had to be supported in his saddle during
the early days of the campaign.</p>
<p>He was away on the enterprise against the Creeks until April, 1814,
at which time he returned to the Hermitage in abominably miserable
health and sadly in need of rest and recuperation. By September, however,
he was up and off again on the extended campaign which began in
Florida and wound up in the successful defense of New Orleans.</p>
<p>After his decisive defeat of Pakenham&rsquo;s army in January, 1815, he returned
home in May; but in October, 1815, he was off to Washington
to receive the congratulations of the President and the plaudits of the
people. He returned home early the next year, writing ahead to have his
overseer instructed that he was on the way and &ldquo;will expect that my
house will be prepared in such a way as will prevent the northern blast
from entering,&rdquo; He was also careful to drop the reminder that &ldquo;we will
want something good to eat and drink on our arrival.&rdquo; Soon after his
return he started out for New Orleans, by way of Mobile, to attend a
celebration in the Crescent City in honor of his great battle.</p>
<p>After this he was at home uninterruptedly for about two years&mdash;until
January, 1818, when he went to Florida for his second campaign there.
In June he returned home and stayed there until the following January
when he and Rachel went on a trip to Washington and the Eastern
cities. It was primarily a political trip, occasioned by the attacks launched
by Jackson&rsquo;s enemies in Congress who sought to squelch him politically
by raising questions as to his conduct in Florida. But the official report
of the inquiry conducted was a complete exoneration of Jackson, and he
proceeded on a tour of triumph to Philadelphia, New York and Baltimore.
In New York he was given the freedom of the city in a gold box,
and Tammany Hall held a banquet in his honor. Rachel&rsquo;s eyes nearly
popped out of her head at all the honors shown her general. In February
they went back home; and it was in the following summer that work
was started on the new Hermitage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<p>In 1821 Jackson was appointed Governor of Florida by President
Monroe and, accompanied by Rachel and little Andrew, he set out for
Pensacola to take over his new office. From Nashville to Pensacola today
is a comfortable day&rsquo;s ride in an automobile over hard-surfaced
roads; but then the trip between the two cities was by a long, round-about
way. A steamboat carried the new governor and his little family to New
Orleans&mdash;down the Cumberland, the Ohio and the Mississippi&mdash;from
whence they proceeded coastwise to Mobile, and then on overland to
the outskirts of Pensacola where Jackson took up his headquarters in a
suburban villa and began his interminable palaver with the Spanish
governor. When they left Nashville the Jacksons evidently had every intention
of making a protracted stay in the new territory, as they made
elaborate arrangements in advance. The family carriage was repaired
and refurbished (to the extent of $300 worth) and this coach was taken
along for the use of the governor and his lady in Pensacola. A tutor was
engaged to look after the boys left at home&mdash;little Hutchings and Lincoya.
But the experience of the Jacksons in Florida was far from satisfactory.
Diplomacy was not the General&rsquo;s long suit, and his patience was
soon exhausted by the long-drawn-out exchange of notes with the slippery
Spaniards. Rachel and little Andrew found the hot weather and
the mosquitoes uncomfortable and annoying&mdash;so much so that the boy
was sent back home at the first opportunity. Furthermore, the pious
Rachel was shocked at the worldliness of the citizens of Pensacola, especially
their failure to observe the Sabbath according to her Presbyterian
lights. Her appeal to the General resulted in his edict announcing that
&ldquo;it is desired by Mrs. Jackson and ordered by General Jackson&rdquo; that the
Sabbath be strictly observed; but, despite this moral victory, she was
never happy while there. Early in October the General and Rachel left
Pensacola, never to return, and started back home. They stopped in
New Orleans long enough for Rachel to buy a handsome sideboard and
some other mahogany furniture for the new house (the General improving
the opportunity to lay in a modest supply of wines and liquors) and
in November they were back in the Hermitage again.</p>
<p>Now Jackson had another long visit at home, for it was not until two
years later in 1823, that he was elected to the United States Senate and
had to go to Washington to serve in that capacity for the second time in
his life.</p>
<p>In going from Nashville to Washington, a trip Jackson made frequently
in the course of his life, he had the choice of two modes of
travel. One was by steamboat: Down the Cumberland to the Ohio, and
then up that stream to Wheeling or Pittsburg and overland through
<span class="pb" id="Page_216">216</span>
Cumberland, Maryland, to Washington. More favored, however, was
the overland route, generally eastward from Nashville through Lebanon,
Liberty, Sparta, Crossville and Kingston to Knoxville in East Tennessee,
then up through Abingdon, Salem, Charlottesville and Fredericksburg
in Virginia, following much the same route as the automobile highway
of today.</p>
<p>When elected to the Senate in 1823 he set out on horseback on the
overland route and pursued his equestrian course as long as the weather
permitted. Then he stabled his horses at a wayside tavern and finished
the journey by stage-coach. He returned to the Hermitage late in May,
1824, by the steamboat route, sending his servant, George, overland to
pick up his horses and take them back home. When he returned to the
next session of the Senate, after spending the summer and fall at the
Hermitage, he took Mrs. Jackson with him and followed the overland
route by way of Lexington, Kentucky, arriving in Washington on December
5th, 1824, &ldquo;after a continuous travel of 28 days.&rdquo; This was just
after the November election in which he had received the plurality of
the electoral votes for President and he had every expectation of remaining
in Washington to be inaugurated in March. The House of Representatives,
however, elected John Quincy Adams President; and in
October, 1825 Jackson resigned from the Senate and returned overland
to Tennessee, muttering objurgations on the fraud and corruption by
which he thought he had been tricked out of the Presidency.</p>
<p>Following his successful Presidential campaign in 1828, which included
a trip to New Orleans in January with Rachel to attend the celebration
of the anniversary of the battle, he left Nashville by steamboat
and proceeded to Wheeling where he was met by a handsome, brand-new
coach drawn by four white horses, and in this regal equipage he
made his entry into Washington.</p>
<p>During his eight years as President, Jackson pursued the plan of returning
to the Hermitage for a summer vacation in alternate years. The
summer of 1829 he spent in Washington, too busy with the duties of his
new office to get away for a rest; but in 1830 he returned to the Hermitage
by steamboat and spent about two months at home. He paid a visit
to Tyree Springs, then a fashionable summer resort near Nashville; and
also found time during the summer to arrange for a parley at Franklin,
Tennessee, with the six chiefs of the Cherokee Indians, with whom he
concluded a treaty for the removal of the tribe west of the Mississippi.</p>
<p>He left the Hermitage on September 1st in his coach, and spent 24
days on the overland trip back to Washington. In the summer of 1831
he went, in company with his old friend Judge Overton, to the Rip Raps
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
in Hampton Roads, near Norfolk. Both the old gentlemen were in bad
health at the time, and they went to the rocky little island at the mouth
of Chesapeake Bay for the beneficial effects of the sea bathing; but, unfortunately,
there is not preserved a picture of Old Hickory in his bathing
suit enjoying the Virginia surf.</p>
<p>His next visit home was in the summer of 1832, when the place was
lightened by the presence of young Andrew and his new bride. General
Jackson left Washington on July 23rd and arrived at the Hermitage on
August 15th, by the overland route. In September he visited Tyree
Springs; but he was back in the White House October 19th, the return
trip also being made by what was then known as &ldquo;the Virginia route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In June of 1833 Jackson took his celebrated trip to New York and
New England&mdash;the famous occasion on which Harvard College conferred
an LL.D. degree on the old warrior&mdash;but he was at the Rip Raps,
enjoying the sea baths, in July and August.</p>
<p>It was not until August, in the summer of 1834, that he made his next
trip to the Hermitage; and by this time he was beginning to feel the
crushing weight of the Presidency on his shoulders. Writing back to a
friend in Washington he announced his arrival home &ldquo;worn down with
ill health, bad roads and heat of weather;&rdquo; but he also spoke of the
pleasure he was deriving from the company of his son&rsquo;s two little children&mdash;little
Rachel &ldquo;as sprightly as a little fairy, and as wild as a little
partridge,&rdquo; to whom he had brought a doll from Washington; and the
infant Andrew III whom he described as &ldquo;a very large, fat boy&rdquo; and
later referred to as &ldquo;a veritable Hercules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of his Washington friends wrote him during the summer expressing
the hope that &ldquo;in the cool and refreshing shades of your own
lawns and the domestic quiet of your own hospitable mansion you will
be enabled to forget, for a while at least I hope, the trouble and toil of
your official station.&rdquo; President Jackson doubtless did try to forget the
cares of office while he was vacationing at home; but that he was not
unmindful of the political possibilities of the overland journey homeward
is shown in a letter he wrote back to Van Buren: &ldquo;I found on my
whole journey everything to cheer us; prosperity everywhere and all
gratified and happy on the prospects of a circulating and stable metallic
currency, and particularly the gold coin, which many had not for years
seen a piece of before we presented them in payment of our bills.&rdquo; And
then he adds naively: &ldquo;I had taken the precaution to lay in as many half
eagles as paid our bills on our passage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question of hard money, it will be recalled, was an acute issue
in the summer of 1834; and it is not surprising that Jackson, the consummate
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
politician, had been sufficiently foresighted to provide himself
with enough gold coins to use in paying his bills as he took the thousand-mile
overland trip from Washington to Nashville through Virginia and
Tennessee. What an unparalleled opportunity it was for the champion
of hard money to demonstrate to the people that he was its very personification;
and it is not hard to form a mental picture of the old
General&rsquo;s breezy gusto as he slapped down his ten-dollar gold pieces on
the small-town tavern counters and watched the favorable reaction of
the pop-eyed citizens. As a matter of fact, gold coins were very scarce at
this time and in order to furnish a supply of them Jackson had started
the mint to turning out half-eagles at the rate of $20,000 a day; and
while he was at the Hermitage in August there was sent to him from
Washington the first eagle struck from a new die that had just been
made.</p>
<p>In September, 1834, he started on the long drive back to Washington,
accompanied by Major Donelson and Mr. Randolph. Before starting out,
however&mdash;for these were the days of Spartan simplicity and unashamed
frankness&mdash;he took the precaution to write to Major Lewis, who was
spending the summer in the White House: &ldquo;Have the House in readiness
to receive us; and say to the chamber maid to have all our beds clear of
bed buggs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The summer of 1835 was spent again at the Rip Raps, going there in
July and spending 41 days.</p>
<p>He was especially anxious to get back to the Hermitage in the summer
of 1836 to see his new house, but it took him 25 days to get there via the
Virginia route. He left Washington on July 10th, but seven days later
had only reached Salem, Virginia, from which point he wrote his son:
&ldquo;I am thus far on my way to the Hermitage, but from the state of the
roads there can be no calculation made when we may reach there. It took
us 7 hours today to travel 10 miles, and in the streets of Salem broke a
singletree and the fore akle of the carriage,&rdquo; It was not until August 4th
that he reached the Hermitage &ldquo;exhausted with bad roads and continued
rains and my horses broke down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time he left the coach at the Hermitage and returned to Washington
by steamboat early in September. He and Major Donelson had an
engagement to meet Mr. Van Buren in Washington and make an excursion
to Niagara Falls to wind up the vacation season; but on account
of his wife&rsquo;s illness Major Donelson did not return with the General and
the trip to the Falls was abandoned.</p>
<p>When in March, 1837, Jackson surrendered to Martin Van Buren what
he had come to regard as &ldquo;a dignified office of abject slavery,&rdquo; he rode on
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
the new Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad from Washington to the end of the
road at Ellicott&rsquo;s Mills, Maryland, where he took the stagecoach to
Wheeling and there embarked on the steamboat for Nashville. There
was a public demonstration at Cincinnati when the boat landed there,
another at Louisville and another when he reached home. But at last he
was back in the quietude of the Hermitage he loved so well; and from
then until his death his traveling was confined to occasional trips to
Nashville, a few visits to Tyree Springs, and a brief campaign tour he
took with his protege, James K. Polk, when he was a candidate for governor
in 1839.</p>

<p class="pcapc">This fa&ccedil;ade never fails to evoke praise from the best informed.
Proportion, mass, real craftsmanship and feeling are assisted by ingenious
solutions of practical problems involved in remodeling. The rhythm of the column
spacing is unorthodox but extremely interesting and beautiful.
The columns themselves are unique, being made of separate boards routed to form the
fluting and with beaded, tongued and grooved joints between the fluting.
Brick bases and applied cast-iron leaves on the capitals are typical examples of the
highly successful ingenuity of the builders, who present a challenge to present-day
architects.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
